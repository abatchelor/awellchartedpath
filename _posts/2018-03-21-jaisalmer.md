We arrived in Jaisalmer after an overnight train journey from Jaipur, which departed around midnight and arrived just before noon. After spending time in [Varnasi](http://site.awellchartedpath.com/blog/2018/03/Varanasi/), [Agra](LINK), and [Jaipur](LINK), we were really looking forward to getting to a _much_ smaller place and seeing if it would feel a bit more livable than anywhere else we had been in India.

The touristy part of Jaisalmer is dominated by the NAME fort, which sits high up, surrounded on all sides by two levels of tall vertical walls separated by a steep hillside of sand. Its smaller than it looks in a lot of photos, and takes less than 20 minutes to walk the road looping around the circumference of its base. The amazing part about it that unlike the forts in other cities we visited that have been preserved as tourist attractions, this one was flourished as a hotspot for shops, restaurants, and homes. There's no charge to enter, since it's basically just a neighborhood, and you're free to wander down alleys looking for interesting food or good views.

We stayed at **Hotel Tokyo Palace**, which ended up being a really great choice. We spent a bit extra on one of their larger rooms, still well within budget, and ended up spending a lot of time in its air conditioning during the hot middle of the day. The restaurant on the roof seemed like one of the best in the area for our needs, and the service was really great. We'd definitely go back if we returned to Jaisalmer.

Ultimately, Jaisalmer was definitely a nice change of pace, but still doesn't have the charm of the places we spent time in Southeast Asia.

**Day 1:** arrival, check-in, lunch on roof, rest, walk into fort (windowsill lassi), fail at finding dinner, dinner on roof

Our sleeper train from Jaipur arrived to the small Jaisalmer station, its terminus, and we found a group of hotel drivers in the parking lot holding up big signs advertising where they were going. A number of hotels in the area, including ours, offer free pick-up/drop-off at the train station, since it's only about a 5-minute drive away and with only a couple trains a day is pretty manageable. It was pretty amazing to not get harassed by a single tuktuk driver and get to our hotel so quickly.

After we got checked in, we had a quick lunch at the rooftop restaurant, rested a bit, and then went for a walk to check out the area. While _much_ more walkable than Varanasi, Agra, or Jaipur, that difference is just because it is so much less crowded, not because there is any infrastructure like sidewalks or crosswalks. Before arriving we had marked some restaurants and sweet shops we wanted to check out, and we were a bit surprised to find that after only 20 minutes of walking counterclockwise around the base of the fort we had been by almost all of them!

We went up into the fort itself and worked our way through the maze to **Surya Restaurant**, which we had seen some recommendations for. We were apparently visiting at an odd hour as we had to ruin the server's nap to seat us in an otherwise-empty restaurant, but that meant we got the best seats in the house: right on a balcony overlooking the city and surrounding area. The view was definitely the best part about the visit, as the banana lassi _may_ have gotten me sick...

We wanted to have dinner at **Sunset Palace Restaurant** but after exiting the fort and circling around the backside to its marked location on Google Maps... found nothing. Turns out it is actually up inside the fort, on the west side. We didn't have the energy to climb back up, so went back to our hotel for dinner. We ended up checking out the menu a couple days later and were glad we hadn't tried to have dinner there, as it was quite limited and more expensive than expected.

**Day 2:** surprise free breakfast, me sick

Unfortunately, I woke up in the middle of the night not feeling well and spent the rest of the early morning hours in close proximity to the bathroom. It broke a nearly 3-month streak dating back to before Christmas in Myanmar of me not feeling sick. After so many warnings before we got here, making it through two weeks of India before getting sick still seems like an accomplishment.

We ended up spending the whole day inside our hotel, with me drinking lots of bottled water and taking occasional naps, while Amy entertained herself. The one bright spot of the morning was the surprise of being given free breakfast at the restaurant. It wasn't included in the room booking, and other guests didn't seem to be given it, and the only explanation we've been able to come up with for why we got it was that we were nice and chatty with the gentleman who runs the restaurant.

**Day 3:** walkabout fort, lake thing, dinner at 1st Gate

We had planned our itinerary through India to allow for a day or two spent sick without causing too much stress, and Jaisalmer was more about the experience overall than a list of sites to check off. Our third day there was our biggest day of exploration, and we again started out by heading up into the fort.

Our goal was to wander through every part of the fort, just to see what was there, and our walk route (zoom into Jaisalmer on the home page to see it) shows we were pretty successful. It feels smaller within than when you're standing down below looking up at it, and there isn't anything too surprising. We found:
- Shops: 
- Restaurants: 
- Viewpoints: 
- Temples: 
- Museum: 
- Ramparts walk: 

After exploring the alleyways of the fort, we headed straight to **NAME OF LAKE**, about a 15-minute walk away. Like much else in Jaisalmer, 

**Day 4:** atm, fort for tea on roof, lunch at hotel, departure

## <i class="fa fa-check-square" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#2495C4;"></i> How We Did with Our Budget

For our time in Agra, we had budgeted as much as 45 USD a night for accommodations. We ended up spending 55 USD per night for our room at **Hotel Atulyaa Taj**, choosing to spend the extra to be right near the Taj Mahal (which didn't end up making a ton of difference). With just two nights here, we were able to balance out that cost with other, cheaper bookings elsewhere in India pretty easily.

We had also budgeted 10 USD per day per person for food and 10 USD per day per person for entertainment, plus an extra 30 USD to cover our Taj Mahal admission. Out of that planned 55 USD total, we ended up spending 117 USD per day on average, with most of that on our car/driver/guide (130 USD including tips). Just for meals, we averaged only 2.8 USD per person, while site admissions took a toll on our budget (51 USD _not_ including the Taj Mahal's 30 USD fee).

One final note: This trip has really made me appreciate how nice it is to _not_ have to tip. For almost everywhere we've been, tips at restaurants are not expected, and hospitality staff are actually trying to help you rather than just get a tip. Being in India, where neither is true, has made me long for the simplicity of not having to worry about tipping, and wish that the U.S. would move to be less tip-based in the service industry.
