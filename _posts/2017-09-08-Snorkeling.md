## Snorkeling Near and Far 

If you learn anything about Hawaii, other than that there are great beaches, it's that you have to go snorkeling. There is a reason everyone says this, it's completely true. 


While we were in Maui for 12 days we went snorkeling almost every day. Most days we would just swim out from the beach in front of the condo where we stayed in Kihei. Swimming out beyond where the waves were breaking, we could see plenty of coral, fish, and even sea turtles. Our first day, even when conditions were less than ideal, we saw 6 turtles but that was not the only nor the best snorkeling we did.

Off the beach in Kiehe, there are several small reefs that offered us easy access to snorkeling 400 feet off the beach where we were staying. While it conditions were not great a couple of the days we went out, with waves churning up sand and reducing visability, it was still

Only a 10 minute drive from the condo in Kiehe, we were able to park at the beach at Ulua beach in Wailea to snorkel. The beach here is smaller than the string in Kiehe but the reef goes out in a near circle from the point about 200 feet. There are portions that are quite shallow, to where I could have stood in chest deep ot even ankle deep water on top of the reef but at the edge the face of the reef is probably around 20 feet with another 4-5 feet of water above that. 

This was some of the best snorkeling we did the whole time we were in Maui. Going in the morning (before 11am) meant the water was clear and waves were small. By the time we came in, closer to 12:00 some of the visability was already reduced as the water became more choppy and stirred up sand. As it got later, we also had to share the reef with more people, so like most things in Maui, it's better to get an early start.

In addition to a variety of tropical fish, we also got to see an octopus (my personal favorite) 4 turtles, and a manta ray.

All those were in addition to the beautiful fish and the coral. We easily could have explored for a lot longer but after two hours of snorkeling we were pretty tired and had to call it quits for the day.
