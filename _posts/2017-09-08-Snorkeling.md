## Snorkeling Near and Far 

If you learn anything about Hawaii, other than that there are great beaches, it's that you have to go snorkeling. There is a reason everyone says this, it's completely true. 


While we were in Maui for 12 days we went snorkeling almost every day. Most days we would just swim out from the beach in front of the condo where we stayed in Kihei. Swimming out beyond where the waves were breaking, we could see plenty of coral, fish, and even sea turtles. Out first day, even when conditions were less than ideal, we saw 6 turtles.
