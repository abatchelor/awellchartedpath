One of our Bucket List items is to snorkel the Great Barrier Reef but we got a pretty wonderful warm-up in Maui. Beyond the beaches and the luaus, Maui has some beautiful reefs and many of them are easily accessible without the need to book a tour or have a boat.

While we were in Maui for 12 days we went snorkeling almost every day. Most days we would just swim out from the beach in front of the condo where we stayed in Kihei. Swimming out beyond where the waves were breaking, we could see plenty of coral, fish, and even sea turtles. Our first day, even when conditions were less than ideal, we saw 6 turtles but that was not the only nor the best snorkeling we did. 

Off the beach in Kihei, there are several small reefs that offered us easy access to snorkeling 400 feet off the beach where we were staying. While it conditions were not great a couple of the days we went out, with waves churning up sand and reducing visability, it still offered turtle sightings and plenty of small fish and anemones.

## <i class="fa fa-check-square" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#2495C4;"></i> Ulua 

Only a 10 minute drive from the condo in Kihei, we were able to park at the beach at Ulua beach in Wailea to snorkel. The beach here is smaller than the string in Kihei but the reef goes out in a near circle from the point about 200 feet. There are portions that are quite shallow, to where I could have stood in chest deep ot even ankle deep water on top of the reef but at the edge the face of the reef is probably around 20 feet with another 4-5 feet of water above that. 

This was some of the best snorkeling we did the whole time we were in Maui. Going in the morning (before 11am) meant the water was clear and waves were small. By the time we came in, closer to 12:00 some of the visability was already reduced as the water became more choppy and stirred up sand. As it got later, we also had to share the reef with more people, so like most things in Maui, it's better to get an early start. 


In addition to a variety of tropical fish, we also got to see an octopus (my personal favorite), 4 turtles, and a manta ray.

<div style="text-align: center;">(You can even see that the octopus was changing color to blend in better with its surroundings)</div>

All those were in addition to the beautiful fish and the coral. We easily could have explored for a lot longer but after two hours of snorkeling we were pretty tired and had to call it quits for the day.

Our third snorkel location was off the coast of Honoapiilani Highway north west of Kihei. Driving along the coast, you get to mile marker 14 and there are plenty of places to pull off and park. When we were there, it was the weekend and several small groups were camping on the beach.

Once you are on the beach, it is quite shallow (up to my knees) up until you start reaching the reef. The reef is quite shallow in many places but there are deeper channels scattered throughout where you can easily swim out into the reef. These will open up to deep canyons that are 20-30 feet deep with plenty of room for diving. We didn't experience much swell while we were there but I could easily see if becoming a problem if you're not paying attention.

This reef, was much bigger than the others we visited reaching about 3/4 of a mile off shore. We didn't cover nearly that distance though. At the Ulua and Kihei reefs, we got to see most if not all of the reef area. At mile marker 14 we just scratched the surface on a two hour snorkel trip. This would be a great reef to visit over and over again, following different channels out on each trip. 

We were rewarded for our efforts with plenty of fish and a few sea turtles, who were clearly less comfortable with tourists than the regularly visited turtles at the first reefs we visited. Instead of ignoring us, these turtles used evasive maneuvers and tried to keep us at a distance.
