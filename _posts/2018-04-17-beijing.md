While we flew in and out of Tokyo-Narita airport on our [around the world air ticket](http://site.awellchartedpath.com/blog/2017/08/RTW-Overview/), our first stop in Japan was Osaka. We stayed for about a week, ate as much ramen as we could, walked a _ton_, and really enjoyed it. It may just be because it is such a contrast to our [experience in India](http://site.awellchartedpath.com/blog/2018/03/new-delhi/), but we were really thankful for how walkable the city is and how willing everyone was to try to help us.

We decided to stay in Osaka, rather than the more-popular-among-tourists Kyoto because throughout our trip we've enjoyed good food and residential neighborhoods a lot more than temples and tourist hotspots. Plus, with a Japan Rail Pass in-hand, Kyoto was just 15 minutes on the Shinkansen "bullet train" away.

Osaka and the surrounding area was one of the most livable destinations we've traveled to so far. The public transportation is _amazing_, most everyone seems to bicycle around for shorter trips, and everything is clean and safe. It honestly left both of us wishing we could easily learn Japanese and spend more time here.

## <i class="fa fa-check-square" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#2495C4;"></i> How We Did with Our Budget in Beijing

For our visit to Japan, we budgeted more than almost anywhere else we're going (and kept the overall time in Japan to two weeks, when we otherwise may have stretched it out a bit more). After so much time in Southeast Asia, prices have definitely been a bit of a shock, but it is ultimately pretty comparable to DC if you stay away from the 50 USD gourmet sushi boxes and dozens of Michelin-starred restaurants.

For our time in Osaka, we had budgeted as much as 90 USD a night for accommodations. We ended up spending 78 USD per night for our Airbnb in Osaka, which had a small kitchenette and everything we needed, despite being in total about the size of our bedroom back in DC.

We had also budgeted 20 USD per day per person for food and 15 USD per day per person for entertainment. Out of that planned 70 USD total, we ended up spending 61 USD per day on average, including almost 50 USD total on metro trips around Osaka and Kyoto. We budgeted separately for our two-week nationwide Japan Rail Pass, which end up costing about 30 USD per person per day (but are still way cheaper than buying bullet train tickets individually!).
