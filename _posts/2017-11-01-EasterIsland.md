Easter Island is small. We covered pretty much the whole island, in six days. When you arrive, it is into a tiny airport. Flights only arrive once or twice a day and when you disembark you walk down the exit stairs straight onto the runway and then casually make your way into the terminal, taking photos and maybe wandering around a bit. The only connecting flight out of the airport is to Tahiti. 

Once we left the airport, about as many people as were on the plane with us were waiting outside with flower necklaces (the first similarity to our time in Hawaii). Almost everyone on the flight was a tourist, we were no exception. For such a small island, unloading a 787 full of tourists seemed like a lot. An island council has actually been trying to limit the number of tourists that can visit every year in an attempt to keep the island from becoming inauthentic and to ensure its sustainability. 

The entire time we were on the island, with the exception of sunset at Tahai and sunrise at Tongariki, we spent a lot of time exploring either just the two of us or with small groups of others. There are no double decker tour buses on the island. At most you'll see 12 passenger vans, so it is difficult to completely overwhelm a sight.
