Early on in our trip planning, I became an avid reader of [Seat61 - the best resource online about train travel all over the world](http://seat61.com/) - and started making a long list of train trips that sounded like they would be fun additions to our trip. At the very top of that list was taking the [Premier Classe train from Cape Town to Johannesburg](https://www.seat61.com/SouthAfrica.htm#Premier-Classe) - a 26+ hour journey across the Great Karoo.

The Premier Classe is the perfect middle-ground in terms of options for trains across South Africa - much better service and more relaxed than the Shosholoza Meyl tourist class train would have been and less stuffy (and less outrageously expensive) than the Blue Train.

We had a wonderful time aboard, with great scenery and a relaxed atmosphere throughout, and only a couple of minor hiccups in the service.

We arrived at Cape Town Station a little after 8:00am and joined a half-full lounge of fellow travelers enjoying some tea and coffee before boarding the train. The lounge itself was convenient and well-staffed, and has a private entrance directly from Old Marine Drive, where they had laid out a welcoming red carpet.

After receiving our cabin assignments we were led out to the train itself, snapped some quick photos, and filed aboard. Most folks had their luggage taken to their rooms by the staff, but we kept a close hold on our backpacks and no one minded. 

The train pulled out right on time at 9:05am and we all filled into the lounge car to meet the staff and get a short briefing on our schedule for the next day. Our trip had only 24 guests aboard a train that can travel 60, so we never felt squeezed for space and met every other passenger on our train.

The trailhead is at the southeast edge of Camps Bay just off Theresa Avenue, at the Theresa Ave Jeep Trail. `-33.963075, 18.384278` 

After taking the initial trail for 15-20 minutes, you walk briefly on the Pipe Track trail, and then turn onto the Kasteelsport trail for the steep climb up the ravine. Once on Kasteelsport, it's more like rocky stairs than a trail, and only fit hikers comfortable with a bit of scrambling should attempt the trek.

## <i class="fa fa-check-square" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#2495C4;"></i> The Old Cableway

When my Great Grandparents went up Table Mountain in 1959, it was via a now-dismantled cableway. The ruins of the upper platform of that system are still notable, and are just off the west side of the main trail after turning right at the top of Kasteelsport. I wonder how many fewer houses they looked out upon from this spot nearly 60 years ago.

## <i class="fa fa-check-square" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#2495C4;"></i>  The trail to the summit

After reaching the top of Kasteelsport turn right, and then turn left. This avoids the most trying part of the more direct trail, while taking you closer to the beautiful reservoirs atop the mountain. There are useful maps and trail markers on small pillars at every trail intersection, so it's difficult to get too lost. There are also painted yellow footsteps at a number of false trails showing the correct way to keep moving.

## <i class="fa fa-check-square" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#2495C4;"></i> At the top

We knew we'd reached the top by how crowded the rocks suddenly became. There are more (and more flat) trails around the top to different photo opportunities, as well as a café with free wifi and a cafeteria-style restaurant. The wifi at the café atop the cableway itself was the fastest we experienced in all of Cape Town, and they had some lovely internal windows to see the workings of the cableway through.

We started our hike at 6:51am, made it to the top at about 10:30am, and were down the mountain via the cableway by 11:15am, where we caught the free shuttle down to the public bus back to our Airbnb. Definitely our best morning in Cape Town, and enough activity to give us an excuse to start happy hour early.
