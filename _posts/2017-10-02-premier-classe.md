Early on in our trip planning, I became an avid reader of [Seat61 - the best resource online about train travel all over the world](http://seat61.com/) - and started making a long list of train trips that sounded like they would be fun additions to our trip. At the very top of that list was taking the [Premier Classe train from Cape Town to Johannesburg](https://www.seat61.com/SouthAfrica.htm#Premier-Classe) - a 26+ hour journey across the Great Karoo.

The Premier Classe is the perfect middle-ground in terms of options for trains across South Africa - much more luxurious and relaxed than the Shosholoza Meyl tourist class train would have been and less stuffy (and less outrageously expensive) than the Blue Train.

We had a wonderful time aboard. There was great scenery, a relaxed atmosphere, and only a couple of minor hiccups in the service.

We arrived at Cape Town Station a little after 8:00am and joined a half-full lounge of fellow travelers enjoying some tea and coffee before boarding the train. The lounge itself was convenient, well-staffed, and has a private entrance directly from Old Marine Drive, where they had laid out a welcoming red carpet.

After receiving our cabin assignments we were led out to the train itself, snapped some quick photos, and filed aboard. Most folks had their luggage taken to their rooms by the staff, but we kept a close hold on our backpacks and no one minded. 

The train pulled out right on time at 9:05am and we all filed into the lounge car to meet the staff and get a short briefing on our schedule for the next day. Our trip had only 24 guests aboard a train that can travel 60, so we never felt squeezed for space and met every other passenger on our train. We also lucked out, in that they started running a brand new train since we booked our tickets, so everything felt very fresh and clean onboard.

## <i class="fa fa-check-square" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#2495C4;"></i> Day One

Our first day aboard was fantastic, and easily one of the best days of our trip so far. We had great views, were pretty much constantly being fed, and all-around felt very taken care of.

We kicked off the morning with a free champagne toast as we pulled out of Cape Town Station, along with some small bites of biltong (South African jerky), potato chips, and nuts. We were then served morning tea and sandwich quarters to make sure we were well held over until lunch.

We almost immediately started running behind schedule due to congestion on the lines as we made our way out of Cape Town, but weren't at all worried about our exact arrival time and barely noticed the many short stops.

As we wound through the mountains east of Cape Town, we moved to the dining car for the first time, sitting at our assigned table (they sometimes pair couples together on 4-tops, but didn't on our journey since they had such a light crowd), and enjoyed a 3-course lunch of salmon, chicken and vegetables, and cheesecake. As with everything we ate on the train, it was reasonably good but nothing special.

In the late afternoon, we settled again in the lounge car to enjoy more tea, this time with choice of carrot or chocolate cake, and to get to know the other passengers some more. The group overall was a nice mix of South Africans and international tourists, including one woman who is a regular on the train since she has family in both cities and doesn't like to fly.

We treated ourselves to a nice bottle of red wine from the Stellenbosch region we had just travelled through (at 6 USD this wasn't much of a splurge) and watched the desert scroll by until we reached Beaufort West Station for a quick stop to change the engines on our train. After stretching our legs in the surprisingly-cool air, we took the rest of our wine down to the dining car for our big dinner.

Similar to lunch, dinner was a 5-course meal of cream-of-vegetable soup, hake, lamb with pumpkin and cheesy cauliflower, chocolate souffl√©, and a cheese plate. The hake and pumpkin were the standouts of the meal, but it was filling and nothing to complain about. I can't think of too many meals as relaxing as finishing a bottle of wine while watching the world slowly rumble by, and knowing that there's nothing to do but head back to your cabin and sleep until morning light.

While we were in the dining car, our cabin had been made up by our car's attendant and was ready for us to have a cozy and comfortable night. After taking two redeye economy flights in a row on our way from Maui to Cape Town, this was truly a luxurious way to sleep while traveling!

## <i class="fa fa-check-square" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#2495C4;"></i> Day Two

While the first day was full of warmth, food, relaxation, and great scenery; the second day was pretty much the opposite. It was an unfortunate end to the great journey that left us confused at the goals of the service.

We woke up in a _freezing_ compartment, which ended up being true of the whole train. While the cabins do have air conditioning capability, they apparently don't have heating. The early morning coffee/tea in your cabin that was promised in the schedule we received onboard would have been a great way to warm up, but unfortunately was never offered to us. 

We joined other passengers - blankets to bundle up in and all - in the lounge car and tried to keep the doors closed as much as possible to keep at least a little bit of heat in. Unfortunately breakfast was only available in the very-cold dining car, so we quickly ate our way through our yogurt & granola, eggs, bacon, sausage, and toast before scampering back to our cabin to warm up under more blankets.

Even more confusing was that after breakfast, the staff seemed to all just disappear. We joined the other passengers back in the lounge car later in the morning for the promised tea, which never materialized. After an hour of waiting some other passengers finally tracked down one staff member to bring some coffee around, and we were told there were no more snacks to be had.

With about 30 minutes to go until our scheduled arrival we were finally given an update on our status - and told that we would arrive about 40 minutes late. While they sometimes provide a Day Two Lunch when delays are longer, this apparently didn't merit it and we went back to our cabin to pack up. Unfortunately that estimate turned out to be very optimistic, and we pulled into Park Station in Johannesburg almost exactly 2 hours late - and very hungry!

## <i class="fa fa-check-square" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#2495C4;"></i> Our Thoughts

### Pros

- **View**: From Table Mountain to seemingly-endless rolling hills, to the vast high desert, the scenery never let us down.
- **Ticket Price**: We paid 250 USD per person, including a travel agent fee since the primary booking website wouldn't accept our foreign credit card. This wasn't much more than a flight would have been, since it also covered a night of accommodations.
- **Onboard Prices**: While all food and the initial champagne toast are included, additional drinks (including bottled water) are extra. The prices were very reasonable and we ended up spending about 10 USD on a couple of beers and a bottle of wine.
- **Photos**: The windows all opened about a third of the way, which made for amazing photo-taking (and a very pleasant breeze in the warmth of Day 1). 
- **Service**... on Day 1: We truly felt like our every need was taken care of, from the constant meals to the perfectly-timed turndown service.
- **Passengers**: We enjoyed chatting with the locals and other tourists on board. We were by far the youngest travelers, but that didn't bother us at all.
- **Unique**: We'll definitely remember this trip forever, and it was a true event rather than just transportation like a quick flight would have been.
- **Train**: We lucked out that our train was only a few months old, but all travelers get their own private cabins (couples or solos) and we were told the lounge car will soon have satellite TV and wifi available.

### Cons

- **Service**... on Day 2: We were honestly left a little baffled at the carelessness of the operation on the second day - at one point we had about 20 passengers in the lounge car sending out volunteers trying to find any staff members on the train and couldn't for about 30 minutes. 
- **Cold**: Nothing ruins a comfortable relaxing time like being chilled to the bone. 
- **Schedule**: The train will be late. We knew this going in (not sure any review on TripAdvisor has ever said it was on time), but the inability to predict an approximate arrival time even within 20 miles of Johannesburg was disappointing. Definitely don't schedule a flight or reservation for the afternoon after a scheduled arrival.

### Overall

Unfortunately, the Premier Classe train was a very inconsistent experience. The first day was amazing and while going to sleep the first night I was wishing it was a 3-day trip instead of the 2-day trip. The carelessness of the staff on the second day was a big disappointment after that, most of all because of how easy it would be to have made us happier by just sticking to the schedule of services they promised (and turning on some heat!). 

We're happy that we did it, but probably wouldn't do it a second time if we're in South Africa anytime soon. There's probably no better way to see the countryside, especially if you don't have anything time sensitive on the other side and are able to set your expectation low about the service onboard.
