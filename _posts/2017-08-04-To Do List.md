## Pre-Trip Checklist 

## The Idea Phase

This phase can last as long as you'd like. Our lasted almost 5 years before we finally went through with it and bought our RTW tickets. Use this time to daydream about places you could go, watch movies, read books, and ask all your friends what places they've loved visiting. 

<i class="fa fa-check-square" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#2495C4;"></i> Watch movies
<i class="fa fa-check-square" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#2495C4;"></i> Read travel books, historical non-fiction, and even publicaitons like the Economist to learn about places you might visit. 
<i class="fa fa-check-square" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#2495C4;"></i> **Make your Bucket List**
- Figure out what your can't miss destinations and activities are. 
- Start big, you can always eliminate as you keep planning.
- Figure out how much each thing on your list would cost. 
- Start incoporating as many as you can into your budget and route planning. 

##The Serious Phase

<i class="fa fa-check-square" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#2495C4;"></i> **Build your Budget** 

- This will help you determine some important factors for your trip, mainly how much you'll need to save because how long it will be before you could leave for your trip is intamately tied to that number. Maybe you need to pinch pennies for 6 months or maybe it's 2 years, either way having a ball park number will help you take the steps you need. 
- Take a look at our <a href="http://site.awellchartedpath.com/blog/2017/09/Budgeting/" target="_blank">budgeting post</a> to get started. 

<i class="fa fa-check-square" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#2495C4;"></i> Learn the rules about your ticket. 
Knowing the rules about what you can and cannot do on your RTW ticket is important to a successful trip if you go this route. Read about how we made the most of our tickets here [INSERT LINK]. 

##The Nitty-Gritty 

<h1> Travel Documents </h1>

<i class="fa fa-check-square" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#2495C4;"></i> **Renew Your Passport**
- Make sure your passport is valid for at least 6 months longer than your trip. 
- If it won't be, start the renewal process early. 
- Save some money by downloading an app for your phone and finding a white wall to make your own passport photos. You can still print them at a CVS but you'll get a lot more for your money. 

<i class="fa fa-check-square" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#2495C4;"></i> **Get Your Visas**
- Getting visas can be time consuming. Figure out how many you'll need, how much they cost, and how long it will take to get them. 
- Give yourself plenty of time, if you can, to avoid a crisis when it is time for your flight and your passport is still at the Chinese Consulate. 
- Many of the vias are good for multiple years and multiple entries so getting it in advance can save you a lot of stress as your departure date gets closer. 

<i class="fa fa-check-square" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#2495C4;"></i> **Book Your Ticket**

<i class="fa fa-check-square" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#2495C4;"></i> **Make Photo Copies of Your Imporant Documents**


<h1> Health and Wellness </h1>

<i class="fa fa-check-square" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#2495C4;"></i> **Purchase travel insurance** 

<i class="fa fa-check-square" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#2495C4;"></i> **Get Health Insurance**
- If you had it through you job and you quit to go travel, then you;ll you'll need new insurance.  
- Look into the options, especially to see if there are any plans with international coverage. 

<i class="fa fa-check-square" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#2495C4;"></i> **Vaccinations**
- Research whether you will need any for destinations you plan to visit. 
- Find out how much they cost and where you can get them.
- Get any anti-malarials you'll need for your trip.

<i class="fa fa-check-square" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#2495C4;"></i> **Schedule Check-up** 
- While you're getting shots you should also schedule time for a check-up with your GP. 
- Consider visiting your dentist if it's been awhile. Take care of any cavities so they won't become a nuisance on your trip. 

  <i class="fa fa-check-square" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#2495C4;"></i> **Get your haircut**
- This obvioulsy isn't a neccessity but I want to make sure I got my hair cut right before I left because I'm planning to just let it grow while we travel. Nate won't have that luxury but at least it will be several weeks before he has to try is first international barber.  
 
 <h1> Your Stuff </h1>
 
<i class="fa fa-check-square" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#2495C4;"></i> **Give up your apartment** 
- Or lease it or call a relator about your house 

<i class="fa fa-check-square" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#2495C4;"></i> **Store What You Want To Keep**
- Get a storage unit or find a nice friend or relative who will store things for you. We were able to skip a storage unit thanks to the kindness of my brother and his house that is large enough to have extra closet space.

<i class="fa fa-check-square" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#2495C4;"></i> **Sell the Rest**
- This can give you some extra travel funds right before you leave. 

<i class="fa fa-check-square" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#2495C4;"></i> **E-cycle any Electronics** 
- If you're cleaning out old phones, laptops, or batteries; be sure to e-cycle them. 
- Stores like Besty Buy and Staples have programs to responsibly dispose of your devices. Take advantage!

<i class="fa fa-check-square" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#2495C4;"></i> **Cancel any Recurring Bills**
- Cable
- Phone
- Magazine subscrptions
- Renter's Insurance

<i class="fa fa-check-square" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#2495C4;"></i> **Go Paperless and Automate all the Bills you Can** 

<i class="fa fa-check-square" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#2495C4;"></i> **Forward your mail**

<h1> Logistics </h1>

<i class="fa fa-check-square" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#2495C4;"></i> **Inform your Job that you're Leaving**
- Give notice at work or take a sabbatical 

<i class="fa fa-check-square" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#2495C4;"></i> **Book Accomodations**
- For right before you leave if you won't have anything in your apartment/house
- We booked a hotel by the airport to have a nice night of stress free relaxation and so we wouldn't have to go far to catch our first flight but staying with friends is also a good option. 
- Your accomodations for your first destination 

<i class="fa fa-check-square" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#2495C4;"></i> **Get an International Drivers License**

<i class="fa fa-check-square" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#2495C4;"></i> **Get your Equipment** 
- You may want a backpack, hiking shoes, or a fancy new camera. Anything you don't have already you should research, budget for, and buy.
- I recommend trying to request some as gifts from friends and family leading up to the trip for birthdays and holidays to offset some of your costs. 


<h1> Your People </h1>

<i class="fa fa-check-square" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#2495C4;"></i> **Tell your Friends and Family** 
- Make sure you let everyone important to you know you'll be leaving. 
- Update their addresses and phone numbers, add them on skype or twitter, or whatever works best for you to keep in touch. 

<i class="fa fa-check-square" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#2495C4;"></i> **Make Time** 
- Don't get too busy planning and packing to see your friends and family.
