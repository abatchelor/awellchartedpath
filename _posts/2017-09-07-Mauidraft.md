## Maui

Starting our trip in Maui always seemed a bit indulgent. It was like a vacation before our year long...vacation. Still I have no regrets. It also helped that we were staying with Nate's parents who were nice enough to feed and entertain us while we were there. 

## 12 Day Itinerary 
1. Land in Maui
2. Snorkeling off the beach, 3 hour hike through the lava fields at La Perouse Bay, shave ice, tacos at Fred's
3. Statistics final, snorkeling, long beach walk
4. Glass bottomed kayaks, snorkeling at Turtle Bay, shave ice, Pita Perfect for dinner
5. Sunrise at Haleakala, hiking and swimming at Na'ili'ili-haele waterfalls on the road to Hana

## Highlights

- Hiking to Na'ili'ili-haele waterfalls
- Snorkeling 
- Haleakala sunrise 

It turns out that while we did some activities that were on the more expensive side, out favorites were relatively low cost. The hike to Na'ili'ili haele was free beyond the cost of having a rental car and gas, snorkeling was free because Nate's parents brought snorkel gear from home (much cheaper to buy on amazon compared to 2 hour or daily rentals), an Haleakala was only $25 + $1.50 for the online reservaion fee for all of us to enjoy the 2+ hour experience. For Haleakala, we also needed the rental car and to plan ahead enough to get a reservation. These activities pale in comparison to the kayaking, guided tours, and luaus that are advertised everywhere you look.

## What we might do differently

- We would have skipped the glass bottom kayaks. Snorkeling is much more flexible, both in navigating and for seeing deeper below the surface. There is nothing wrong with kayaking but just get a normal kayak to enjoying paddling around and then snorkel instead. 
- We would have had more shave ice. We didn't have it every day and that is a big shame.
