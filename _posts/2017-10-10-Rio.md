We spent a whirlwind of 4 full days in Rio de Janiero. We could have easily spent a month in Rio but we also wanted to get away from cities for a while and head to an island and a smaller city on the coast, so compromises were made. I'll let you know when it's all over if we made the right choice. 


## <i class="fa fa-check-square" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#2495C4;"></i>What We Did 

When we arrived in Rio, we unfortunately felt a little under prepared. We had gotten caught up enjoying ourselves in South Africa and São Paulo and had forgotten to make a plan for Rio. Before the trip, I'd spent some time reading about the hisoty and politics of Rio, especially around the World Cup and Olympics but hadn't actually put together a schedule of things we wanted to do our booked anything. It turns out knowing about political malfesance and structural inequality don't always equate to an enjoyable visit? 

**Day 1:** For our first day, we did some quick googling and found a "free" (tip based) walking tour through the downtown. Staying in Ipanema, we were never at risk of missing out on the lovely (though impressively crowded) beaches, so this seemed like it would ensure we got a broader experience of Rio. Admittedly, we typically try to avoid these kinds of tours. They make us feel a little like cattle or school children being sheparded around. Despite my hesitation, I have to admit I enjoyed the tour. I would have preferred to walk a little faster (my D.C./N.Y.C pace is not the norm here) and I did feel selfconscious multiple times when our little group gathered around the tour guide but I learned some Brazilian history and saw some beautiful buildings that I otherwise would have either missed entirely or wouldn't have known what I was looking at. 

Most importantly, we got to stop to eat a few things. We stopped at Cafeteria Colombo, which I had already been told was a "must visit" and I was not disappointed. It is the oldest cafe in Rio and had been where the politicians and socialites went to be seen by the important people. You can have a cappachino and either a delicious chocolate pastery or a savory chicken pastel, soak up the beauty of the building and if you have more than the 3 outfits I'm rotating through right now it is a perfect place to dress up a little and pretend you're rubbing elbows with the rich and famous. 

Afer our tour, we made our way back over to Copacabana and walked down the beach to Ipanema. These beaches are famous for a reason. The are situated between mountains, have gentle waves, and there are a million things going on everywhere you look. Between the vendors that are everywhere selling everything from cheese on a stick to stylish sun hats, the infamous teeny tiny bikinis everywhere, the children running around, or the volleyball games that are really soccer over a volleyball net; there is a lot to take in. 

People watching is excellent though so, we grabbed a beachside table under an umbrella and had some caiphirinhas while we soaked up the scene. 

**Day 2:** While we've been traveling, Nate and I have been doing a lot of walking. I mean a lot. Most days at 10+ mile days. Rio was no exception. We started our second day walking around the lagoon that was only a couple of blocks from our apartment. The lagoon has a walking path around it and on Saturday it was packed with runners, bikers, families stopping at play grounds, and plenty of stands selling coconuts. Compared to South Africa, the number of people we've seen exerciseing is impressive here and despite all the walking we've been doing it's making me feel bad that I didn't bring proper running shoes, even though I definitely didn't have any extra room in my backpack. 

After walking about halfway around the lagoon, we reached Parque Lage. It was a mansion at one point but is now a park, visual art school, and cafe. It has free entrance and so we walked around a little before grabbing a bus back to head to our next big adventure. We only spent a little time at Parque Lage because we knew it was also on the agenda for the next day. 

Then came the big adventure. You may have noticed a recurring theme, and it will come up again. Nate and I climb mountains. Sometimes climbing is really just hiking but this time there was some actual climbing going on too. We booked a guide, Mingo through Ancoraue Climbing to hike Sugar Loaf (Pão de Açúcar), Originally we had hope to hike all the way up Corcovado to Chirst the Redeember but over the summer too many hikers were robbed on their way up for us to be comfortable. So, while it will likely be controversial, we skipped Christ the Redeemer entirely and opted for Sugar Loaf instead. 

Admittedly, I didn't fully internalize what I was getting myself into when Nate suggested the hike with a little climbing. I don't climb. I am also in denial about having a fear of heights. Still, I agreed and off we went Mingo. The Sugar Loaf hike starts out simple enough, you walk along a nice flat path around the side by the ocean. Kids are rollar blading, people are jogging, and there is a party boat just off shore blasting house music. How bad could this be?

Then we turn off the path and the path basically disappears. No more flat walkway. Instead, we are supposed to walk up an incline that looks pretty close to smooth. Mingo assures me that if you put weight on the balls of your feet that it will be fine and that using your hands to basically crawl up the mountain won't help. I know he is probably right but what do I do? Use my hands almost the entire way up? Turns out I don't trust my shoes to keep me from sliding down the side of a mountain. Nate took to it like a natural though.

Little did I know that after over an hour of this steep incline search for footholds, I would reach a portion for climbing. When I say I didn't know. Nate definitely told me. Yet in my head I pictured the climbing wall at my college gym, not a mountain with little crevices I'd need to cling to. 

Luckily I'm stubborn and not one to be outdone. So into the harness I went. First Mingo went up, then Nate, both with little to no fanfare. Then it was my turn. It was going pretty well up until I was supposed to reach under a rock, hold on, then do a sort of swing step to bring myself over to the next foot hold before pushing myself over the top of the wall. I got through the swinging around portion better than I had expected but when it came time to push/pull muslef up I got stuck. I couldn't make it. So I plastered myself to the mountain, swearing mostly under my breath and knowing I was about to slide off. After letting me struggle a little to get up on my own, Nate offered a helping hand and I made it up. It was not graceful. I should really have done some practice climbs in the safety of a rock gym or something.  After just a bit more sheer face walking, we made it to the top and got to enjoy a great view. As an added bonus, for those that make the climb, they don't charge you to take the cable car back down the mountain (!), which was great because I definitely wasn't going down the way we came up. After 2.3 miles that felt way longer than that, the hike was a little bit of an adrenile boost but left me happy and tired, just like any good hike should. 

We won't be taking Mingo up on his offer for more challenging climbs in Brazil or Chile but I do plan on checking out some gyms when this whole trip is over.

**Day 5:** We took a van to a boat to Illha Grande. 

## <i class="fa fa-check-square" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#2495C4;"></i>How We Did with Our Budget

OUr budget for Rio was the same as for São Paulo, We budgeted as much as $85 dollars a night for accomodations but we were able to find a apartment in  Ipanema with a full kitchen for only $59 a night. The apartment wasn't anything special but the location was great and it had everything we needed. 

We also budgeted $15 dollars per day per person for food and $15 dollars per day per person for entertainment. However, for Nate's birthday we ended up with a little extra-budget funding that allowed us to have a nicer dinner out and do a food tour that otherwise would have blown-up our budget. Still, we kept to our usual habit of making 2 meals a day at the AirBnB to save money, with the exception of our food tour day, and ended up coming in at an average of $49 a day for the two of us (out of $60 a day that we budgeted). This did not include our amazing food tour but included our guided hike/climb up Sugar Loaf. 

We almost exlcusively took public transporation. The subway system is very easy to use, clean, and the announcements are also made in English. In a sad bit of genius, there is also a women only car on the subway for rush our commutes. Is it sad that it is necessary? Yes. Would I ride in it every single day if I lived here? Yes.
