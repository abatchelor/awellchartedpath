After [enjoying the solitude on Koh Pu](http://site.awellchartedpath.com/blog/2018/02/Koh-Pu/) and [the more lively Koh Lanta](LINK) we took yet another ferry to Koh Lipe and from there a long-tail to Ko Adang.

Koh Adang is largely uninhabited forrest and a national park while Koh Lipe is home to about 500 people but caters to many more tourists. We stayed at the **Adang Resort** which is the only hotel (though there are also some cabins rented through the national park service) on the island. The hotel ran long-tail boat shuttles to Lipe in the morning and evening so we were easily able to sping time there each day. 

## <i class="fa fa-check-square" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#2495C4;"></i> What We Did on Koh Adang

We arrived from Koh Lanta in the afternoon by ferry to a floating plaform a few hundred feet from the beach where you have to buy a national park entrance ticket (200 Baht or ~6.35 USD/person) and a ticket for a boat to take you either to Lipe or Adang (50 Baht/1.60 USD per person for Lipe and 100 Baht/3.18 USD person for Adang). 

The Adang Resort is on a small strip of beach across from Sunset Beach on the western side of Lipe. The water is clear and beautiful. During high-tide we could easily swim around but, as in Koh Pu, at low-tide the water retreated to expose lots of rocks and coral. So, we swam around and enjoyed the beach before having dinner at the hotel restaurant. The food was fine, we originally thought it was very overpriced only to find that food was equally expensive at most of hte restaurants on Lipe as well. The restaurant also ran out of sea food, likely because of the high demand from other restaurants and hotels for the increased number of visitors for Chinese New Year, so we split a delicious tofu dish and a masaman curry each night for a little of 12 USD/person. These were some of the lower cost options but considering a 6 USD dinner expensive is something that could only happen after spending so long traveling in southeast Asia.

Our days on Koh Adang followed the same routine. We would get up and enjoy the free buffet breakfast before taking the boat shuttle to Lipe for lunch, returning in the afternoon to swim, watching sunset and the crabs that scurried across the beach, eatting dinner at the hotel restaurant. Rinse and repeat. 

Our first morning we did venture off on a short hike. Just off the end of the beach where we were staying was a path that led to **"Pirate Waterfall"**. I have no idea what it had to do with pirates but it was an enjoyable hour long round trip. The path was pretty well marked though it did require that we climb up a short segment of rope to get up a large rock before reaching the falls. The falls themselves were not spectacular but were nice enough and it made fore a good bit of morning exercise. 

On Lipe the main attraction is **Walking Street**. It’s strip of shops, restaurants, and tourist offices where we would walk each day. Sadly, when we first explored the street, we found that several of the restaurants, including one Nate particularly wanted to visit for Northern Thai food, were closed for Chinese New Year and would not be open the whole time we were there. Disappointed, we still managed to find good food, including a northern-Thai sour pork salad for Nate. Better than the food we found for lunch was the very inexpense (~1 USD) smoothies/iced cocoas we found at a stall right near the beach. The stall seemed to cater equally to locals and tourists, which was not true of most places on walking street. The single woman making drinks wasn’t the fastest but was friendly and the drinks were delicious and cheap. We would take them down onto Sunrise beach to sit on the white sand beach and people watch before we needed to return westward to get the boat back to Adang.

On our last day, also our last day in Thailand, we took our usual boat over to Lipe, walked with our big backpacks down to Walking Street for lunch, and then made our way to the ferry and immigration office for our departure. At this point we are pretty expert at the ferry process and managed to get ourselves and our bags on the boat without incident. One quirk of the process for getting of the ferry is that you give the immigration officer your passport but it is returned by staff on the boat when they call out nationalities and have you sort though a stack of others from your country to find your own. Through this process Nate and I foudn out we were the only Americans on the boat but that there were multiple groups of people from the Ukraine. 

## <i class="fa fa-check-square" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#2495C4;"></i> How We Did with Our Budget

For our time on Koh Aang, we had budgeted as much as 42 USD a night for accommodations. We ended up splurging on **Adang Resort** for ~75 USD/night. Luckily, we had a lot of savings from our bungalow on Koh Lanta to offset the extra cost. We had also budgeted 8 USD per day per person for food and 10 USD per day per person for entertainment. Out of that planned 36 USD per day we ended up spending about 33 USD per day on average, including our national park admission fee (14 USD).

## <i class="fa fa-check-square" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#2495C4;"></i> Thailand Summary

Since we spent so long in Thailand, I wanted to summarize the experience a little more than I have for other places. 

**Spending**

For our 28 days in Thailand, we averaged 15 USD per person each day on food and entertainment, 42 USD on hotel stays (though the costs varried from just 21 USD on Lanta to 75 on Adang), and spent 435 USD on trains and ferries. 

**Island Preferences**

We visited (mostly Nate) a lot of islands on this trip. Each has pros and cons but here are our main take-aways from each and our ranking for which ones we would consider returning to. 

Would come again...
1. Koh Tao- 

2. Koh Lanta- Lanta had a good mix of nice resorts as well as budget accomodations, including our least expensive accomodation while in Thailand. There are more restaurants and bars to chose from to get a wide variety in type of food and price. There are also conveniences like 7-11 and mini-markets to pick up snacks, water, and toiletries or use an ATM. The beaches are some of the nicest with fewer rocks and coral, even at low tide. 

Would probably pass on...
1. Koh Pu- This island is perfect if you want to escape the world. There are not many people, internet is limited, and you can bask on the beautiful beach to your hearts content. The downside is that there isn’t much else to do and you will be limited to the restaurants attached to guest houses for food. 
 
2. Koh Phan Gan- 
3. Ko Adang- Adang is a nice middle ground if you’re looking for some peace and tranquility but want access to restaurants, bars, and shopping. For us, taking the boat back and forth was a littly annoying as the tides made coming and going certain times impossible. Lipe is definitely on the more expensive side for Thai islands as well. 

If we could do it all again, I would have changed our plans entirely and visited just one island and instead backtracked to northern Thailand to Chiang Mai and/or Chiang Rai instead. We didn’t do that largely because of the timing and location of my meditaiton retreat, which I wouldn’t want to give up, BUT if not for that I think it would have been worth it to suffer through the extra long travel days. Since we aren’t burned out from work, we didn’t actually need all the recharging you can do on these beautiful beaches and got a little antsy for something more like our time in Bangkok.
