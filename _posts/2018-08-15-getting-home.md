We spent four days getting home from Mauritius in style, flying in lay-flat business class seats for the first time ever and thoroughly enjoying our journey through Johannesburg, Zurich, and Chicago on the way to the Reno area for my brother's wedding.

In contrast to our [trip from Maui to Cape Town](LINK) in economy, and all of our budget travel over the past year, this was the height of luxury and a really special treat for us.

Our overall longhaul flight strategy was to buy [an RTW ticket](LINK) taking us westward around the world from South Africa and then back to Mauritius (off the east coast of southern Africa) at the end of our trip. This was a lot cheaper than booking that tickets from the United States directly, but meant we had to get ourselves to and from Africa. Luckily we had planned ahead, picked up a few credit card point bonuses, and saved up our miles to get both of us from Maui to Cape Town at the start of our trip and from Mauritius back to the US at the end of the trip.

I had researched award availability (using United miles) in the years leading up to our trip and consistently found good availability to fly one-stop from Mauritius to San Francisco on Turkish Airlines, especially when booking 10-12 months ahead of time. Unfortunately when that window came around for us, Turkish Airlines took away all of their award seat inventory for the route and we had to figure out a different plan. After checking daily for availability for flights from Mauritius to any major US city for our dates throughout September and October 2017, shortly before Halloween my search finally turned up a result: to fly in business class from Mauritius to Chicago, though Johannesburg and Zurich, for only 80,000 miles each. After a bit of debate about whether it was worth it, since that was double the miles we had planned to use on economy flights, we went ahead and booked it since we weren't sure we'd ever have another miles option.

Looking back on that decision 10 months later, it was absolutely the correct one: I continued checking regularly and didn't find another option to use miles on until two weeks before our departure date when last-minute options started to open up, though all would have cost even more points and had worse routing. 

We actually lucked out on our timing as well, since shortly after booking the tickets South African Airways changed the timing of their flight from Mauritius to Johannesburg, requiring a 24 hour and 25-minute layover in Johannesburg before continuing and removing it as an option for other travelers to book, since airlines only count it as a single "trip" if the layover is less than 24 hours (since we already had the ticket, we got to keep it and just stay overnight in Johannesburg).

One of the perks of our business class tickets, even though we obtained them using airlines miles, was access to airport lounges in Mauritius, Johannesburg, and Zurich before each of our flights. This was especially handy as due to our schedule we ended up spending around 3 hours in each of them–3 hours that would have been a real drag to spend in the terminal's general area but was actually a delight to spend eating and drinking free refreshments in a relaxing lounge area.

In Mauritius we had access to the Amédée Maingard Lounge run by Air Mauritius, which takes up two floors at one end of the terminal, with the top floor overlooking some departure gates and part of the tarmac. Since we had to return our rental car a full 3.5 hours before our flight was scheduled to depart we spent a solid 3 hours in the lounge and had a great time. Their food was mainly Indian curries and small snacks that were great, if a bit surprising for the island, and their full bar let us properly start celebrating making it to the end of our trip in one piece. 

In Johannesburg, we had a surprise

In Zurich, 

Ultimately the lounges may have been the most valuable part of the experience for me, as it saved us a bunch of money on airport snacks, let us truly relax before each of our flights, and made the whole experience feel top-notch.
