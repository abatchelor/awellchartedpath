São Paulo was a first for both of us and a new continent! Neither of us had ever been to South America and I think São Paulo was a nice way to start the trip off before we headed to Rio and the more popular/famous beaches and sights.

Right from the start a couple of things stood out. The first was that I have been _very_ spoiled traveling to places where English, even when it is not the official or primary language, is regularly spoken or I've been in Germany and Austria where my German is still good enough to get around comfortably. Coming from South Africa, where almost everyone we encountered spoke at least some English, the near complete lack of english in Brazil so far has been striking and humbling and we bumble through using a few phrases (mostly "não falo português"- I don't speak Portuguese), pointing at menus, and hoping the signs we can't read don't say anything too important. I also attempt to speak German sometimes, which doesn't make sense but is what my brain is determined is the correct answer.  

The second experience that stood out both in South Africa, especially at the many weekend markets we visited, and in Brazil so far, is that my very practical, good for a year, mono-chromatic wardrobe is pretty dull compared to the locals and my very practical, no frills, and probably good for my skin, break from make-up is not helping me out much where my mono-chromatic wardrobe leaves off. This is exhasberated by my new Instagram habit that involves following all these other 20-somethings that are traveling. I love seeing the places we'll be visiting but they are professional bloggers who are not living out of a back-pack for a year and have beautiful clothes (in many colors), perfect hair, and make-up that I would have to seek professional help to match. All this is to say that I'm still getting used to my minimalist travel style and so if you don't see many pictures of me in all the beautiful/intersting scenery, I'm still getting used to what I look like without my business clothes, make-up, and the help of a hair dryer.

Now for the fun parts...

**Day 1:** We arrived and got enough groceries to have breakfast the next day. The apartment we were staying in was conveniently only two blocks for one of the only markets still open on a Sunday night. Then we promptly went to sleep (the time difference from South Africa was a little rough but 11 hour flights are starting to feel like a walk in the park). 

**Day 2:** We walked down **Avenida Paulista** and enjoyed the hustle and buslte of the busy business street. We walked through **Tenente Siquera Campos Park**, which is a little urban jungle with walking paths and playgrounds that makes our small patches of green space in DC look pretty boring. Then it was on to the metro to visit **São Paulo Cathedral** (Catedral da Sé). We didn't want to join mass, so we headed to lunch at **Mercado Municipal** instead.

The market was shuttered in several sections but we found one section that was still busy with activity. Vendors were selling fruits of every kind you could imagine and competing aggresively for business. We passed up the attempt to barter for fruit and moved on to **Bar do Mané**. We didn't know what we were getting ourselves into. Bar do Mané was established in 1933 and is apparently (little did we know) quite famous. We were able to grab a small table and even though we were unable to understand most of the menu, we were able to order two of the sandwiches that had pitcures. Nate happened to get their famous mortadella and even decided to be daring and get the large version. When it arrived, there was enough meat on his sandwich to make 4-5 normal sandwiches. It was the biggest pile of meat masqerading as a sandwich that I've ever seen. Still, the food was delicious and quite affordable. We left full and happy. What more could you ask for?

From there we attempted to visit **Jardim da Luz** (only to find that it is closed on Monday). Disappointed, we headed back for some real grocery shopping and to make dinner. An important aspect of the whole day was that it poured the rain _all day_ and by the time we got back to the apartment we were throughly soaked. It took two days for my poor ballet flats to dry out. We were determined not to let the rain ruin our day but it can really change your experience discovering a new city...

**Day 3:** We visited the **Museu de Arte (MASP)** on Avenida Paulista because it is free on Tuesdays (!). I especially enjoyed the <a href="https://www.guerrillagirls.com/" target="_blank"> Gorilla Girls</a> exhibit and recognized the unfortunate (intentional?) irony that the exhibit shared a space with the work of a male artist who focused exclusively on female nudes.

Then we walked down **Rua Oscar Fierro**, which is packed with stylish boutiques that featured beautiful evening gowns that sadly did not seem like a neccessity for the rest of the trip. Unfortunately, I started to feel ill (probably my body adjusting to this new _temporary_ non-vegetarian life) and so we took a long afternoon break. Luckily I rallied enough to visit **JoJo Ramen** for dinner only a couple of blocks from our apartment. The ramen was delicious and I attempted to speak German to make up for my complete lack of Portuquese and Japanese (also an option) vocabulary. The staff was very patient with us and one staff member, who was originally from the Philippines but moved to São Paulo 9 months ago, felt our pain and had a lovely conversation with us in English.

The second image is a piece at the MAC and it's a purring, touchable, cat.</i></p></div>

**Day 4:** We walked to Parque Ibirapuera, which is comparable to Central Park. It's a large park with plenty of bike paths, running trails, exercise parks, museums, concert venues, and more stands selling fresh coconuts than you could count. We ended up walking about 5 miles and visiting both the **Museum of Modern Art (MAM)** and the **Museum of Contemporary Art (MAC)**. Full disclosure, when we came across MAM, we thought it was MAC and otherwise would not have visited. MAC is free (!), while MAM is about $2 per person. MAC has a lovely rooftop deck that looks out over the park and the city, while MAM is small and has a room that's full of plants (see photo above). If you find yourself in São Paulo, I would suggest skipping MAC and heading across the elevated walkway to MAM. 

We started walking toward **Liberdade** (Little Japan), which Wikipedia says is home to the largest Japanses community outside of Japan. Immigration started in the early 1900s as poor farmers in Japan sought jobs on coffee plantation for a chance at a better life. Now the diaspora is over half a million in Liberdade alone. 

<div style="text-align: center; max-width: calc(100% - 20px);"><a href="/static/assets/img/blog/SPSkyline.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="/static/assets/img/blog/SPSkyline.jpg" width="45%"></a> <a href="/static/assets/img/blog/Liberdade.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="/static/assets/img/blog/Liberdade.jpeg" width="45%"></a></div>

On the way to Liberdade, we stopped at **Suzaku** for lunch. The staff at the restaurant again spoke both Portuguese and Japanese but no English. Eventually we figured out that there was a fixed lunch special that you could order. This was great because it only required pointing at one thing, sitting back, and letting the food come. The only downside was that we weren't sure what food would be coming. It turned out to be appetizers of a cucumber salad, goyza, two kinds of dumplings, grilled salmon, and pan-fried mushrooms. That was just the "first course" and was followed by a huge platter of at least a dozen kinds of sushi, and a large conical salmon salad roll. If all that wasn't enough, then dessert came with the option of chocolate icecream of banana flambe with vanilla icecream. Like our experience at Bar do Mané, we didn't really know what we were getting ourselves into but we left full and happy.  

**Day 5:** Unfortunately, our time in São Paulo came to and end in only 5 days. Ths was our last day and with our flight to Rio at lunchtime, we didn't get to do much beyond have some breakfast, pack up our backpacks and head to the airport again. It felt like we'd only just arrived.
