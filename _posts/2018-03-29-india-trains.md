Before arriving in India, we had already taken long-distance trains in South Africa, Myanmar, Vietnam, and Thailand, and shorter trains in many other countries covering a total of 3,347 miles. During our 24 days in India, we took nine long-distance train rides, including five overnight journeys, and covered a total of ### miles.

OVERALL FEELINGS ABOUT IT

## Our Route




## <i class="fa fa-check-square" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#2495C4;"></i> Getting Tickets

We wanted to maximize time in Bagan and settled on a plan to take this overnight train back to Yangon on New Year's Day, arriving just a handful of hours before our onward flight from Yangon to Hanoi on January 2. Unfortunately tickets for our train would go on sale the day before we arrived in Bagan and given the holiday might sell out that same day. Given how annoying it would be to end up missing our next flight, we buckled and paid [a travel agent](http://www.exoticmyanmartravel.com/) to secure tickets for us in the sole sleeper car in the train. They were easy to work with and had the quaint handwritten tickets dropped off to our hotel while we were in Bagan.

### Delhi to Varanasi on the Swatantrta Senani Express

After spending most of the afternoon wandering around New Delhi, we took a break in the air conditioning of our hotel lobby and then decided it was time to get to the train station when a wedding party arrived. We ended up arriving at New Delhi Train Station (NDLS) at 6:30pm, ahead of our 8:40pm scheduled departure. After arriving to the very modern and fully-featured Delhi Airport, we were surprised to find that the main train station in New Delhi was more or less barren. After months of easy access to 7-11s and cheap noodles throughout Southeast Asia, it was a bit of a shock to not find any convenience stores.

Our train's departure was delayed to 11:15pm, so we made a full tour of the station (which has 16 platforms and terminals on either side). We eventually found some small stands selling bottled water and books, and finally one restaurant run by the railway on the 2nd floor of the western terminal. Its possible there is usually one in the other terminal as well, but there was construction closing lots of it. After a basic meal we settled into the Upper Class Waiting Room until around 10:30pm when the train ahead of ours on our platform departed. 

Not long after, our train pulled in, we found coach HA-1, and got the _very_ nice surprise after all that waiting that the online seating chart was wrong, and our cabin of the coach was a coupe, with only two berths, so we wouldn't need to share with anyone. We left right at 11:15pm as promised, and quickly settled in to get some sleep. We knew we'd arrive later than the scheduled 8:25am the next morning, but didn't expect the full nine hours of delay that we ended up experiencing. Luckily we didn't have anything firm booked to do in the afternoon, as we ended up getting to our hotel in Varanasi at sunset, somehow exhausted even though we just sat around most of the day.

Our AC1 cabin (the highest on Indian trains) was comfortable enough, with clean bed linens provided. We enjoyed both breakfast and lunch served by a train attendant, and which didn't get us sick. He managed to overcharge us for breakfast since we were starving and not paying close enough attention, but I had my revenge when he came to collect our lunch payment and only got the remainder he deserved for the two meals overall. If you're getting food onboard and Indian train, I'd recommend you ask to see the menu card they're all supposed to carry, since it lists prices (even though many items may not be available on your specific train).

### Varanasi to Agra on the Marudhar Express

After the delays of our first journey, we made sure to schedule activities for the afternoon before departure so we at least wouldn't waste that time. We got back to our hotel with just enough time to eat, get some food packed to have as dinner on the train, and get a rickshaw to the train station. 

This was our one journey overnight in AC2 class, which is very similar to the highest AC1 class, except that: (1) all of the cabins are open to the hallway, and (2) there are beds running lengthwise along the hallway as well, so the perpendicular beds are shorter than in AC1. This class honestly would have been fine for all of our journeys, but because AC1 wasn't that much more expensive and fit into our budget, we decided to just enjoy it (AC1 wasn't offered on this train, though).

After a lot of confusion on the train platform, as a different train was loading where the information screens said our train would be, we finally heard an announcement that our train had switched to the other side of the platform, and moments later it pulled up. The coach order was also the reverse of expected, so everyone on the platform had to scramble to swap places lengthwise up/down the train and get on board. While we booked two tickets all the way back in December, we only actually had one confirmed bed until the afternoon of travel, since the other ticket came from the Reservation Against Confirmation (RAC) allotment, meaning you're guaranteed space on the train but may not have a bed if no one who _is_ confirmed cancels. Luckily someone did cancel, but our beds were not in the same cabin. After trying a bit to find someone traveling alone in one of our cabins and also disembarking at Agra we gave up and were ready to spend the journey apart. But, in probably the single kindest act we experienced in India, the train's ticket collector (without being asked) offered to reassign the bed of a passenger getting on later so we could sleep in the same cabin. Hooray!

As we [found in Vietnam](LINK), cultural differences really come out when sharing a train cabin overnight. I was amazed that none of the locals silenced their cell phones, and everyone seemed perfectly satisfied trying to sleep while someone a couple beds away carried on a loud conversation. Luckily we had earplugs and eye masks and were able to get more sleep than we expected.

While we left right on time, the train stopped pretty frequently overnight and by the time we woke up (10 minutes before an on-time arrival would have been) we were three and a half hours delayed. Unfortunately no one ever came through to sell breakfast, so we waited hungrily until we arrived at Agra Fort station at XX:XX and hopped in a car to our hotel.

### Agra to Jaipur on the Allahabad Jaipur Express

Our shortest train journey in India, the hop from Agra to Jaipur is scheduled at a mere 5.5 hours. Since that's not enough time for a real rest, we booked a morning ticket so we could get on our way and arrive to Jaipur right around check-in time for our next hotel.

We were again in AC2, choosing not to pay the premium for AC1 since we weren't planning on sleeping anyway, but ended up getting lucky: our berths were all alone in their cabin, as the other half of it had been used as a storage closet by the railway. We departed from Agra Cantt station, which was the quietest station we've experienced in India. We left only XX minutes late, enjoyed a take-away breakfast from our hotel onboard, and arrived to Jaipur a mere XX minutes late.

If every train ride in India were like this, we'd be pretty happy!


## <i class="fa fa-check-square" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#2495C4;"></i> Eating

Both dinner and breakfast were delivered to us while the train was stopped at intermediate stations (transferring freight, not passengers, we think). Somewhat comically, meals were not handed out on trays or even by railroad staff, but by vendors beside the tracks who had packed the meals in styrofoam and plastic bags before handing them into the car through the window. The "train manager" apparently has contacts along the route and phones in orders to be prepared before the train reaches that station. None of our food was _good_, but none of it made us sick either, so we can't complain too much.

## <i class="fa fa-check-square" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#2495C4;"></i> Sleeping

When we boarded we found two sheets and two pillows on our side of the cabin, and unfortunately there was no turndown service common on sleepers in other countries. Luckily we had the example of the other young couple to follow and clumsily figured out how to convert the lower seats into a flat bed. The pillowcases and sheets _were_ clean, but to be truly comfortable we would have needed double of each.

The biggest barrier to quality sleep was the jerking, stopping, and starting of the train. We had been warned ahead of time about how bumpy the tracks would be, and they were, but most difficult to sleep through was the sudden braking and acceleration randomly throughout the night. It was definitely still worth it to pay a bit extra for a bed instead of a seat, and both of us did get some sleep onboard.

## <i class="fa fa-check-square" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#2495C4;"></i> Getting Scammed

One of the experiences we enjoyed most about our time in Myanmar was how hospitable and honest almost everyone we interacted with was. Street vendors we couldn't communicate with would charge a fair price and make correct change; touts were few and far between; and we didn't feel like we constantly had to be on guard. Unfortunately that streak came to an end on our train trip when despite our best efforts at clarifying prices the bill delivered by our "train manager" for food consumed onboard was a whopping 34,000 kyat (25 USD) when our average cost per meal elsewhere was 3,000 kyat (~2 USD). The Myanmar nationals, who had slightly different dishes but about the same amount of food, were charged less than 10,000 kyat total. When he came to collect payment we disputed a couple of the more inflated prices and ended up paying 30,000 kyat (22 USD) before disembarking in Yangon. 

At these prices getting scammed like this isn't a huge deal, but was a disappointing way to end our travels in Myanmar. If we had another trip to take we would decline all offers from the "train manager" and just hang out the window dealing directly with street vendors at stops along the way (or pack a picnic if we had a good way to do so).

### Overall

We're happy that we did it, but glad we don't have a return trip coming up anytime soon. There is something magical about long-distance rail travel and the chance to interact with locals and really relax. And there's probably no better way to see the countryside, especially if you don't have anything time sensitive on the other side and are able to set your expectations low about the service onboard.
