Right off the bat, I have to say that diving The Great Barrier Reef is one of the coolest things I’ve ever done. Scuba The Three Sisters on Milln reef was the most awe inspiring thing I’ve ever seen. David Attenborough documentaries, which I have seen many, are amazing but just don’t do it justice. Despite how beautiful it was, we decided not to rent an underwater camera. We decided it would be better to focus on seeing everything, concentrating on our bouyancy and what we needed to do for scuba diving, and not trying to capture it all. So, we may get a couple of photos from a few people on our boat that had cameras but its possible the memories will live exclusively in our heads. You’ll just have to take my word for it when I say it is incredible. 

We have been planning our dive on the reef for almost as long as we’ve been planning the trip. There are a lot of options for diving the reef at different price points. One the less expensive options is to take a day trip to snorkel or dive on a large ship that can take 200-300 people at a time. These can be found for under $100 per person. We wanted to be able enoy our time on the reef more. Being surrounded by so many other people while trying to enjoy the reef did not sound enjoyable. We may never get to see the reef like this again given the damage done by climate change and polution. So, we decided to make one of our largest splurges to really enjoy it. 

We got two spots on a sail boat, [Coral Sea Dreaming, for an overnight trip to the reef](LINK). The boat maxed out with 12 passengers and there were actually only 8 people for our trip with 4 staff. We got a private cabin that had a full size bed but not much else, meals were included and were simple but filling. 

Most importantly, this boat was able to do “intro dives” with people that are not certified to dive. Getting certified takes around 4 days and is often quite expensive. We didn’t want to commit to getting certified until we found out if we actually liked scuba diving. If we didn’t, we would be able to snorkel as much as we wanted. 

After doing some basic introduction to how to dive - using the regulator to breathe, clearing a regulator, not holding your breath, how to sink and surface, etc - we ended up doing 4 dives. Three were during the day and one was actually a night dive, which according to our skipper their boat is one of two that are able to take un-certified divers out at night.

We spent our 24 hours on reef at Milln Reef, it’s about **X miles off the coast, near X**. Our first dive was a little nerve racking for me. Despite having the basics from our intro to diving, I didn’t yet know how to use my breath to control my bouyancy (floating or sinking) and I wasn’t really comfortable swimming on my own. Luckily, this was the least eventful dive so I was able to warm up a bit before we got to the next, increasingly amazing dives. 

**Night Dive**
Diving at night is insane. The stars are bright above but there was a new moon and only a couple of lights on the boat, and no other ships in sight. The water is pitch black. 

When you dive, you have a small but powerful flashlight. Using the flashlight, you can see a circle with a diameter of about 1-2 meters. There were four of us diving, Nate and I, plus two instructors; so with all our lights you could see a little more. 

There were a few incredible things we saw during our night dive. My favorite was watching red snapper use the beams of our flashlights to hunt. Red snapper can be around a meter long and hunt in groups. When we would leave our lights on a smaller fish, the snapper would move in to try to catch it and chase it around. 

We also got to see sleeping fish that hide in the coral for protection from the large predator fish at night. One we saw was a parrot fish, which is a brightly colored fish that eats coral. They are bright blue, purple, green, and red in patches. The parrot fish create a mucus bubble around themselves at night to help hide themselves from predators because they can no longer smell them. We were able to see the bubble as the fish was sleeping in a little coral tunnel. 

The one somewhat creepy part of the dive was when you shine your light into a crevice or out into the water and see two shiny dots staring back at you. Some are small dots that belond to shrimp and crabs but others are larger fish or sharks. What you don’t know is when you move your light, where those shiny eyes go and how many are behind you. In general, we were the biggest thing in the area so we didn’t have to worry to much but it definitely leaves you feeling like you’re being watched. 

Finally, we got to see two sharks. One was a reef shark and the other was a white tip shark. They weren’t hunting, just hanging out on the bottom but were still a highlight.

**The Three Sisters**

The dive and snorkeling at the Three Sisters blew my mind. I’ve seen impressive things and done a good amount of travel. We were even at Machu Picchu recently. It was incredible but was nowhere near as impressive as this section of reef. 

We had spent the night sheltered at our second dive sight and in the morning made our way to the Three Sisters. The Three Sisters are three pennicles of coral a little apart from a larger chunk of reef that is more exposed to the nutrients of the currents, making them a thriving habitat. We did our last dive the morning of our second day and it lasted an hour, our longest dive and the maximum time we could dive. 

Every minute of the dive was incredible. Accourding to our dive instructors, the visability was just average but for me it was birght and crystal clear, even if you couldn’t see the bottom standing on the boat. We made our way from the main reef to the first and second sister but the third was too far for us to make it. 

The coral was so colorful and so clearly alive. It’s all different shapes, though my favorite looked like huge solid ferns that stretch out from the main body of the coral. The fish like was also diverse with tiny fish that could blend almost seamlessly into coral up to large schools of silver fish that are 3 feet long. Some of the schools of fish also interacted together, smaller ones moving inbetween the larger ones.

We don’t have any photos of our dive at this point but the two images above are from the Coral Sea Dreaming materials that looks just like what we experienced. 


Nothing I can say will do justice to how wonderful this experience was. If you get the chance, you should go to the Great Barrier Reef. It’s expensive, probably prhibitively so for many people, but it is life changing and it could disappear. The reef has already experienced extinction multiple times. It is not out of the question that it will happen again.
