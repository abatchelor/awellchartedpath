The Palermo neighborhood is the most recommended area for visitors on all the travel sights. We were also informed by the owner of the apartment we'd be staying in that it is the best part of Buenos Aires. We enjoyed San Telmo but it would be hard to argue that Palermo isn't wonderful.

**Day 8:** Our first day in Palermo, we set off to explore a collection of parks north of the neighborhood. Little did we know, even when it is not a holiday, lots of things are closed on Mondays. This apparently even includes parks. So visitng the Bosque de Palermo park and all its lakes wasn't an option. We walked around the edges looking at the lakes and little islands from the other side of a fence. We also had no luck with the Eco-park, though it seems to be closed for an extended period of time. We still had a very enjoyable walk and the weather was excellent. 

We also explored Palermo Soho, one of the smaller subdivisions of Palermo. It is packed with cafes, restaurants, and shops. Again, the single packback that has to hold all my belongings was a damper on doing any shopping but I did get to enjoy plenty of restaurants and cafes.

**Day 9:** As a special treat, I decided that I would take a yoga class. There was a studio only 3 blocks from our apartment with English-speaking instructors that I was excited to try. It has been harder than I thought to make time to exercise while we've been traveling. We do plenty of walking but making time and finding the energy to do yoga by myself in whatever space I can find in the apartment we are in at the time has been challenging. Taking a class again was a lovely change of pace and left me feeling energized. I think I'll make it a regular practice to try and find a studio in cities where we stay longer than a couple of days. It was also a nice change of pace for Nate and I to have some time apart. We spend basically all of our time together, which is great in many ways but since he was not interested in joining the yoga class with me, it was a nice break.

Our next stop of the day was not as successful as my monring yoga class though. We visited Museo Evita, which despite many reviews online and write-ups in guide books, was possibly the most disappointing museum I've ever visited. Evita was a very interesting person. Before we left for the trip I watched the movie about her staring Madonna and read her autobiography. There is a lot of material available. Honestly, I learned more from Madonna than I did from the museum. If you want to see some of her outfits up close and in person, then this is a great stop. Otherwise, it is absolutely not worth it. Information was sparse and the glowing praise of Evita was so skewed as to be distracting.  

We wrapped up the day with a walk through the Botanical Garden. It is much smaller than others we've visited so far but was still a pretty repreive from the city and free, so no complaints here!

**Day 10:** Cafe con Leche and Milalunes, Flores Generica, Museo de Bellas Artes, Parilla Pena for dinner

## <i class="fa fa-check-square" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#2495C4;"></i>The Food, Oh the Food

I can't go any further without going into more detail about the food we had in Buenos Aires. We didn't do a food tour like we did in [Rio](www.awellchartedpath.com/blog/Rio) but we had some great food.

**Empanadas**: These are _everywhere_ in Buenos Aires. We tried our fair share including everything from those available pre-made at the grocery store (an easy dinner but nothing in comparison to the delcicious ones available) to homemade, hand-folded ones at several restaurants. Our stand-out favorites were both from **La Corencia**. Mine was a Humita (sweet corn) empanada and Nate's was a spicy beef one. Competition was tight though and we tried over a dozen kinds of empanadas over our time in Buenos Aires.
 
**Medialunas**: Not quite as ubiquitous as empanadas, medialunas are buttery crossiants that are a breakfast/snack food offered at almost every cafe we passed. Most advertise either 2 or 3 medialunas paired with a cafe con leche as a deal. Both the medialunas at the Panamericano and at La Panea Rosa were my favorite. It was only the most strained self-control that kept me from gettnig 2-3 of these little bits of heavenly goodness every sinle day. 

I've found a few recipes though and plan to try my hand at making them, including a rum/sugar glaze, when I get back from this adventure. 

**Parilla Pena**

## <i class="fa fa-check-square" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#2495C4;"></i>How We Did with Our Budget

We had originally budgeted as much as $70 dollars a night for accomodations. We were $1 USD over per night on our San Telmo apartment but well under at $60 per night for the second week in Palermo, leaving us with a little extra savings overall.

One of the most notable shifts in our budget was that we had originally planned $24 a day for food and $30 for entertainment. Instead, we spent about twice as much on average ($49.25) on food and only $9 a day on entertainment. Basically, food was our entertainment here and I have absolutely no regrets about it, though it's probably good we walked so much...
