After the hustle and bustle of Yangon, we made our way to Inle Lake. Instead of multi-lane roads we had to dart across dodging cars, the road was too narrow for two large trucks to pass on it and had no markings at all. Cars became fewer and the number of motorbikes loaded down with people and parcels of all different sizes increased.

First off, I have to say that we borrowed heavily from [this Travelfish intenerary](LINK).

Our first day, we arrived to Nyangshew in the afternoon and so we made our way to the jetty to find a boat tour. When you get to the jetty, right on the edge of town, it is not difficult to find willing boats. Even before we got to the jetty, men on motorbikes would slow down enough to ask us if we needed a boat for the next day. We wanted to go straight to the boat drivers though, and so we bypassed the men on motorbikes and pushed on to the jetty. Our research had told us that it would cost between 18,000 (13.50 USD) and 25,000 (18.50 USD) kyat to hire a boat for the day. Because we wanted to visit the many stupas of Indein at the far end of the lake, we expected to pay around 25,000 kyat. 

<div style=“text-align: center; max-width: calc(100% - 20px);”><a href=“/static/assets/img/blog/PazLakeView.jpg” target=“_blank”><img src=“/static/assets/img/blog/PazLakeView.jpg” width=“45%”></a> <a href=“/static/assets/img/blog/PazMtCouple.jpg” target=“_blank”><img src=“/static/assets/img/blog/PazMtCouple.jpg” width=“45%”></a></div><p></p>

We spoke to one of the first drivers that approached us, learned about his proposed route and we were quoted 22,000 kyat. This would have been very reasonable but we wanted to compare trips and costs with a couple of other drivers along the jetty. So, we said we would be back. The next woman we spoke to wanted 25,000 and when we tried to negotiate downwards to at least meet our previous quote she insisted that we should pay the higher amount because it was Christmas. We passed and would have continued on but the first man we talked to had followed us and dropped his price to only 17,000 kyat clearly afraid of missing out on the fare. 

So, we agreed to meet back at the jetty at 6:30am and gave him a 5,000 kyat deposit so that he could buy fuel for the boat. 

Our only other task for the day was getting a bus to Mandalay for the next leg of our trip. There are probably at least as many tour and travel type agents in Nyaungshwe as anything else so deciding where to go to get the bus wasn’t easy. We stopped in several shops to ask about their buses and prices before deciding on a minibus that cost 12,500 kyat (9.17 USD) per person (the lowest quote we got) for the 7-10 hour drive to Manadalay. 

With our chores completed we ended the day with a delicious dinner of dimsum very near our hotel so we didn’t have to walk too far on the dusty and dark road to get back after dinner.

## <i class=“fa fa-check-square” aria-hidden=“true” style=“color:#2495C4;”></i> Day 2

Having booked our boat trip for our third and last day, we spent our second day riding some of the free bikes provided by our guesthouse around the lake. In hindsight, we probably should have paid a little money for some nicer bikes. We picked two of the bikes that had both working brakes and gears but then realized my bike’s gears didn’t actually work and the seat of Nate’s bike had a stripped bolt that meant it kept tilting up while you rode. After only about 10 minutes we ended up switching bikes so Nate had to work a little harder and I had to put up with adjusting the seat any time I went over a large bump, which on the roads around the lake was frequent. 

Determined not to let the bikes ruin our fun, we roade counter-clockwise around the lake through some small villages and past pagodas and swampy land on the edge of the lake. Instead of going around the entire lake, we took a shortcut but stopping at a dock to hire a boat to take both us and our bikes across the lake to pick up the road again. There are multiple places along the way where you could stop to get a boat and the men at those docks called out that this is where we were supposed to cross and some even followed us down the road on their motorbikes telling us we should turn around and that we’d missed the chance to take a boat across the lake. We hadn’t though and found the dock we were looking for. Unfortunatly, an enterprising young man, again on a motorbike, followed us to the dock and while we couldn’t understand the Burmese conversations, we think he told the other drivers he’d gotten us from the road and we were his fare. We had done no such thing but at the time didn’t see a way to avoid it as all the other drivers no longer wanted to engage with us. So to get us and our bikes across the lake took 12,000 kyat, almost as much as we planned to pay for a full day on the lake, and only took 20 minutes.

Once on the other side, we continued our journey around the lake toward a much needed lunch. 

Our final stop on our self-guided bike tour was at the Red Mountain Vineyard. Recommendations of things to do when your not on the lake focus on two main options: hot springs and wine tasting. After reading reviews of the hot springs, we decided to pass by those and try some Burmese wine. 

The view from the vineyard is quite nice and the area for wine tasting is shaded from the sun, which in the afternoon at 80 degrees was a welcome respite. We tried two white wines and two red wines for 5,000 kyat (3.67 USD) each. The wine was honestly not my favorite, though the white wine was better than the red. After Chile and Argentina, maybe I’ve been too spoiled. Still, the view and a break from the heat made the visit completely worth it. 

Tired and sweaty, we made our way back into town for dinner and a much needed shower.

## <i class=“fa fa-check-square” aria-hidden=“true” style=“color:#2495C4;”></i> Day 3
 
 At 6:00am, before the sun had come up, we made our way from our hotel to the jetty to meet our driver for the day. Despite hearing that it was best to get an early start, we didn’t see any other tourists out as early as we were. Luckily, our driver was ready and waiting for us when we made it to the dock and we climbed into the long boat to snuggle up under the blankets they provided to protect against the chilly morning. 
 
Leaving town toward the lake, the boats heading to town were loaded with a dozen locals or completely full of produce or other goods. One we passed had rows of neatly lined up lettuce from one end of the boat to the other.  

The sun had not risen yet and so a heavy mist was still settled on the lake. It limited viability but made for a romantic though slightly eerie atmosphere. 

Most people report that right on the edge of town before the lake really opens up, there are fisherman performing the style of one-legged fishing/paddling that is famous on the lake in exchange for a small tip. We were apparently too early for this show though as there wasn’t a fisherman (actually fishing or otherwise) to be seen. Apparently most people sleep in a bit more before starting their days on the lake. 

<div style=“text-align: center; max-width: calc(100% - 20px);”><a href=“/static/assets/img/blog/PazLakeView.jpg” target=“_blank”><img src=“/static/assets/img/blog/PazLakeView.jpg” width=“45%”></a> <a href=“/static/assets/img/blog/PazMtCouple.jpg” target=“_blank”><img src=“/static/assets/img/blog/PazMtCouple.jpg” width=“45%”></a></div><p></p>

We made several stops during the day but the best one was to Indein (also sometimes called Inthein). It is at the far side of the lake from Nyaungshwe and takes almost 2 hours to reach by boat but it is competely worth it. We arrived before the rush so the river leading to the docks wasn’t packed with boats yet. We eaisily found a place to dock and then walked up to the bustling market. The 5-day markets are one of the highlights of a trip to Inle Lake but this one may be a more regular one because the rotating market was supposed to be further up the lake that day. 

Beyond the market is a hillside covered in (according to our driver) about 1,500 stupas. Some are old and falling apart and others were built in the last few years. The older brick ones are slowly being reclaimed by the forest with trees sprouting from the top and their roots breaking up the structures of the stupas. The newer stupas are packed around the central pagoda on the hill where we found monks eating their breakfast and at least a dozen puppies following people around hoping for some scraps for their own breakfast. 

When you enter the long covered corrider at the bottom of the hill, you may have to pay a 500 kyat “photo taking fee” if instead you loop around to any of the other places you can reach the stupas from, you wouldn’t have to pay but it was such a small fee we paid it an went on our way. The corrider is full of vendors selling all types of tchotchkes, clothes, and jewelry.
