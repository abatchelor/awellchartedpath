## Budgeting for a RTW Trip: How much does it Cost?

How much traveling for a year and whether or not we could afford it were big questions for us when we started thinking about this trip.  Especially because when we started planning, one of us was still in graduate school.

You can find many stories about how different people financed their long term travel, though many of them gravitate to low-buget  options (sleeping in hostels every night and avoiding eating out) or are on the opposite end of the spectrun with travel guides and magazines showing off villas you can stay in for only $1,200 a night. A seperate category of people who could fall into either of the previous groups also spend all or parts of their trip working remotely or getting a short-term job in the countries they visit to offset the cost of travel.

We knew we wanted something that would include a little more room for comforts but would also be something we could afford. We had one distint advantage because we spent 5 years thinking about and planning the trip; we also had 5 years to save for the cost of the trip. 

The first budget estimate we pulled together in 2013 was that it would cost $62,176 (one we took into account inflation). Today, we've refined our cost estimates and ended up at **$62,000** for 2 for almost 1 year of travel. 

There are a few reasons that we get to $31,000 per person instead of something closer to $10,000, which I've seen some people report for their year of travel. 

- **We are not staying in hostels.** Almost all of our stays will be in private Airbnbs, some will be shared space Airbnbs, there will be a few hotel rooms and some staying with friends and family along the way too but there will be no dorm style 12 person room with rows of bunk beds and a shared bathroom down the hall. Some people love that experience, meet a lot of interesting people, and save a lot of money but it's not what we're looking for.

If you're traveling alone, staying in private Airbnbs is very likely not afforadble but splitting the cost between 2 people makes it more comparable to getting two beds in a hostel and we were willing to pay extra for the privacy. 

- **We have budgeted for some big ticket items.** Our trip includes 2 days of diving on the Great Barrier Reef, a train ride across South Africa, hiking Machu Picchu, and a full 90 days in the Schengen Zone. If you focus in on countries were your money goes farther, think southeast Asia, instead of visiting high cost countries in Europe you'll be able to cut your costs significantly. For example, we budgeted $1,426 for two weeks in Vietnam and $2,235 for 2 weeks in Italy.

- **We still plan to cook.** Even though we are going to pay a bit more for our accomodations, we still plan to be frugal when it comes to food. That means cooking most meals, picking up snacks at local grocerys/markets, and keeping our alcohol consumption to a minimum.                     

- **We are not planning to work.** Some people get jobs bartending or teaching English while they travel, others are able to work remotely because their profession doesn't depend on a physcial office space. At least at this point, we are not planning to pick up work along the way to offset out costs.


## Building the Budget

With the big picture considerations about our travel style out of the way, we can get into the nitty-gritty details of how we put together our budget and then you can use our Google spreadsheet to make adjustments to fit your travel style. You might find that the crazy trip you'd love to do isn't as expensive as you thought.

To get costs for each country, we made estimates about the cost of non-RTW transporation, visas, accomodations, entertainment, food, and special treats. We had an entry for each of these categories for each stop on our trip. We added to this the cost of our RTW flights, travelers' insurance, and phone bills. OUr $62,000 estimate also does not include the cost of any clothes or equipment we got for this trip. A lot of what we are taking we already had and we were able to get many of the other items as gifts over the last several years. For more on packing and the cost of equipment see our packing list posts for <a href="http://site.awellchartedpath.com/planning/2017/08/02/Packing.html" target="_blank"> a female</a> and for <a href="http://site.awellchartedpath.com/planning/2017/08/03/Nate-Packing-List.html" target="_blank"> a male</a>.

- Transporation 

Entries in the budget for non-RTW transportation includes trains, buses, and boats to take day trips and to visit other cities that we couldn't fit into our 16 RTW flights. This includes the train across South Africa, the flights in South East Asia, and all the trains and ferries we'll take in Europe. 

- Accomodations
 
 To get the cost for accomodations, we researched the range of costs for Airbnbs in areas where that was a good option, and private hostel rooms or low cost hotels in places where it wasn't. 
 
 - Food/Drink
 
For food, I used a lot of advice for <a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-guides/" target="_blank"> Nomadic Matt</a> and some research on average cost of groceries for different countries. Doing this let us budget $8 a day for food in Thailand per person and $20 in London. Spending just $20 a day in London may seem crazy but we'll buy most of our food at the grocery store because we're only stay places where there is at least a basic kitchen or a hotplate. 

- Special Treats/Bucket List Items

For us this category included an overnight sail boat trip out to snorket/dive the Great Barrier Reef, spend two days in Petra, visit Machu Picchu, and do some wine tasting trips in South Africa and Chile.
