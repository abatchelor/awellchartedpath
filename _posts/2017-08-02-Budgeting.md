## Budgeting for a RTW Trip: How much does it Cost?

How much traveling for a year and whether or not we could afford it were big questions for us when we started thinking about this trip.  Especially because when we started planning, one of us was still in graduate school.

The internet offers a multitude of reports on how different individuals have financed long term travel, though many of them gravitate to the low-buget sleeping in hostels every night and avoiding eating out or are on the opposite end of the spectrun with travel guides and magazines showing off villas you can stay in for only $1,200 a night. Others spend parts of their trip working remotely or getting a short-term job in the countries they visit to offset the cost of travel.

We knew we wanted something that would include a little more room for comforts but would also be something we could afford. We had one distint advantage because we spent 5 years thinking about and planning the trip, we also had 5 years to save for the cost of the trip. 

Our first budget estimate we pulled together in 2013 was that it would cost $62,176. Today, we've refined our cost estimates and ended up at **$62,000** flat for 2 for almost 1 year of travel. 

There are a few reasons that we get to $31,000 per person instead of the $10,000 I've seen some people report for their year of travel. 

- **We are not staying in hostels.** Almost all of our stays will be in private Airbnbs, some will be shared space Airbnb, a few hotel rooms and some staying with friends and family along the way. If you're traveling alone, this is very likely not an afforadble way to do it but splitting the cost between 2 people makes it more comparable to getting two beds in a hostel and we were willing to pay extra for the privacy. 

- **We have budgeted for some big ticket items.** Our trip includes 2 days of diving on the Great Barrier Reef, a train ride across South Africa, hiking Machu Picchu, and a fell 90 days in the Schengen Zone. If you focus in on countries were your money goes farther, think southeast Asia, instead of visiting high cost countries in Europe you'll be able to cut your costs significantly. For example, we budgeted $1,426 for two weeks in Vietnam and $2,235 for 2 weeks in Italy.

- **We still plan to cook.** Even though we are going to pay a bit more for our accomodations, we still plan to be frugal when it comes to food. That means cooking most meals, picking up snacks at local grocerys/markets and keeping our alcohol consumption to a minimum.                     

- **We are not planning to work.** Some people get jobs bartending or teaching English while they travel, others are able to work remotely because their profession doesn't depend on a physcial office space. At least at this point, we are not planning to pick up work along the way to offset out costs. 


## Building the Budget

With the big picture considerations about the choice we decided to make out of the way, we can get into the nitty-gritty details of how we put together our budget and then you can use our Google spreadsheet to make adjustments to fit your travel style. 

To get estimated costs for each country, we made estimates about the cost of the RTW tickets, non-RTW transporation costs, visas, accomodations, entertainment, food, and special treats. We had an 
entry for each of these categories for each stop on our trip. 

Entries in the budget for non-RTW transportation includes trains, buses, and boats to take day trips, visit other cities in a country. This includes the train across South Africa, the flights in South East Asia, and all the trains and ferries we'll take in Europe. 

 To get the cost for accomodations, we researched the range of costs for Airbnbs in areas where that was a good option and private hostel rooms in places where it wasn't. 
 
  For food, I used a lot of advice for Nomadic Matt [INSERT LINK] and some research on average cost of groceries for different countries.
