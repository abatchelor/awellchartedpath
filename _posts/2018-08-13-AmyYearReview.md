I spent a lot of time crunching data to tell me what I felt about this year of traveling, where my favorite places were, how often I got sick, how many places we visited, and how much money we spent. Data can only take you so far though. When the data ends there is still a squishy bit full of feelings, fear, hopes, and regrets that are all twisted up and I'm still slowly sorting through as we head back to "real life", whatever that means now.

I am blissfully able to say I have very few regrets about this trip. We were mostly healthy, safe, and had no major incidents. 

Knowing what I know now, I would have skipped a few places (Mandalay and Paraty I'm looking at you). I wouldn't have booked the cute B&B in Bangkok for the wrong dates or booked the wrong hotel in Yangon. 

At the end of the day, I think we maximized our budget well and made sure we did all the things we really wanted to do, even if it meant cutting back other times.

At this point, I have no idea. My plans haven't worked out as I hoped so far but at some point in the near/mid-term Nate and I will move back to Washington, D.C. and start working in policy and politics. We don't have jobs lined up (gasp!) and until we figure out the job part we won't be figuring out the apartment etc. 

So, our homelessness and unemployment continues. 

I can say that I am _so_ excited to sit in the same room with my friends and talk to them rather than hearing their distant voices over spotty internet connections. 

I'm going back to being vegetarian and working my way to vegan. Spending a year being much more flexible with my eating meant that I got to try a lot of new things and I didn't have to worry so much when communications barriers meant I had little to no idea what I was going to get. Now that my life will settle down though, I want to have a more sustainable diet. It makes me feel better physically and mentally. 

I will hopefully finish writing the textbook I've been working on since I finished my meditation retreat in Thailand. By the end of the month I'll know if the publisher I've been working with is going to sign me on a contract (fingers crossed!). 

I wish I could wrap this whole thing up in a nice neat bow but it didn't work out that way. The risk was still worth it. I may disagree if I'm still homeless (technically not homeless thanks to Nate's parents) and unemployed come December but you can check back in with me then. 

Until then, that's all folks. Thanks for following along on this crazy adventure.
