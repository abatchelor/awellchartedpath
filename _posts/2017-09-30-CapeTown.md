## <i class="fa fa-check-square" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#2495C4;"></i>Highlights

Our absolute favorite thing from Cape Town was the early morning hike up Table Mountain. 

Beyond that, getting to catch up with Ferdinand in Johannesburg was wonderful. Getting to see friends along the way will be one of the best parts of travel. Plus it will keep Nate and I from going crazy with just each other for company every day.


## <i class="fa fa-check-square" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#2495C4;"></i>What We Might Do Differently

We should have prioritized hiking Lion's Head for sunset when the weather was nicer early in the week. By putting it off to the end, we didn't have an alternative when the clouds rolled in and ruined any chance of a nice sunset. We still hiked but the bottle of wine I carried around all day did not turn into sundowners with a view. Instead we just hiked up and then hiked quickly back down.

## <i class="fa fa-check-square" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#2495C4;"></i>How We Did with Our Budget

Cape Town was less expensive that we had anticipated. Going grocery shopping (Pick'n'Pay for staples like bread and cheese, Woolworths for prepared food and vegetables) we could feed ourselves breafast and dinner for the 11 days we were in Cape Town for $99.12. That also included some shampoo and conditioner in addition to the food.
