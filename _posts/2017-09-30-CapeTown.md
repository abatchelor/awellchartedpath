## <i class="fa fa-check-square" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#2495C4;"></i>Highlights

Our absolute favorite thing from Cape Town was the early morning hike up Table Mountain. 

Beyond that, getting to catch up with Ferdinand in Johannesburg was wonderful. Getting to see friends along the way will be one of the best parts of travel. Plus it will keep Nate and I from going crazy with just each other for company every day.


## <i class="fa fa-check-square" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#2495C4;"></i>What We Might Do Differently

We should have prioritized hiking Lion's Head for sunset when the weather was nicer early in the week. By putting it off to the end, we didn't have an alternative when the clouds rolled in and ruined any chance of a nice sunset. We still hiked but the bottle of wine I carried around all day did not turn into sundowners with a view. Instead we just hiked up and then hiked quickly back down.

When our Uber driver was intimidated away from our pick up at Ghandi Square, we should have just walked back to Chancellor House to get a car rather than walking back to Ferdinand's apartment. Like most places, Uber is taking market share from traditional taxi drivers and those tensions have caused problems around train stations and major malls in Johannesburg. We didn't know we were on taxi turf but should have moved back into the area we were familiar with rather than pushing on. 

## <i class="fa fa-check-square" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#2495C4;"></i>How We Did with Our Budget

Cape Town was less expensive that we had anticipated. Going grocery shopping (Pick'n'Pay for staples like bread and cheese, Woolworths for prepared food and vegetables) we could feed ourselves breafast and dinner for the 11 days we were in Cape Town for $99.12. That also included some shampoo and conditioner in addition to the food. 

We had originally planned to spend a little under $2,900 for the two weeks in South Africa. About half ($1,050) was for accomodations but we ended up slightly under budget ($78) in Cape Town and thanks to Ferdinand putting us up in Johannesburg we didn't need to spend the $220 we had set aside for accomodations there. 

We were also under budget for food and entertainment. The biggest savings came from not doing a shark diving trip I'd originally planned for and doing a vineyard day trip instead. Even after paying for the tours we had plenty of extra funds budgeted to pick up a few bottles of our favorite wines to bring home with us. 

Unfortunately, some of these savings had to go directly back into paying for some items for South America after multiple attempts to book tickets for buses and for Machu Picchu failed and we had to pay extra to get a travel agent to make the bookings for us.  

In Johannesburg, we spent a lot more on Uber because the public transportation options were not as good for us. Staying with Ferdinand was a big help for our budget though and gave us the flexibility to spend more going out for dinner and drinks to enjoy our time catching up with him and meeting his South African friends.
