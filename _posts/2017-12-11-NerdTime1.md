For those of you who know me well, it won’t be surprising to you that I have been collecting data every day to be able to analyze how the trip is going. Before we left on the trip, I anticipated some of the quesitons everyone would ask throughout our travel and when we got back were: where was your favorite place? and why?

I imagine that most (normal?) people just go with their gut. They have a sense of where they enjoyed the most but that can be distorted with time and different circumstances. So, I decided I would track our happiness each day with a score out of 10 (a validated scale for gauging someones happiness) and then find out how strong the correlations are between our happiness levels and factors like what the weather was like, whether or not we were with friends/family, and how much money we spent each day. Don’t worry, I know that _correlation is not causation_ but as an RCT would have been impossible under these circumstances, correlation will just have to do. 

So, I’ll be summarizing the data for each continent as we go and then hope to have a snazzy graphical analysis of the whole trip at the end (I know, you can hardly wait). 

**Happiest Places**

Using a scale from 1-10 with 10 being that the day couldn’t have been any better, I had 6 days that were perfect 10s over the first three months of the trip and Nate had 4. 

Amy’s Perfect 10s: the day we climbed Table Mountain, the day at the Old Buiscuit Mill and doing gin tasting, the first night on the overnight train from Cape Town to Johannesburg, hiking Sugar Loaf in Rio, and two days of exploring on Easter Island.

Nate’s Perfect 10s: hiking Table Mountain, the wine tour in Stellenbosch, the first night on the train from Cape Town to Johannesburg, and the day we took the ATV around Easter Island. 

Looking at these, it seems there is a bias towards earlier places on the trip. Other 50% of my happiest days were in Cape Town and 75% of Nate’s were. It may be that with time, it takes more to be _really_ perfect when you’re seeing cool new places everyday. 

Interestingly, if we take the average of the happieness scores across the days we spent in each place Nate and I agree on the overall happiest place, yet neither of us had “perfect 10” days there: Ilha Grande. 

Amy’s Top 3 Places:                 Nate’s Tope 3 Places:
1. Ilha Grande                      1. Ilha Grande
2. Easter Island                    2. Easter Island
3. Cape Town                        3. Rio 

Amy’s Bottom 3 Places:              Nate’s Bottom 3 Places:
1. Sao Paolo                        1. La Paz
2. Paraty                           2. Maui
3. Puno                             3. Puno
