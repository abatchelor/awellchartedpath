We used New Delhi as our arrival and departure point for our 24-day India itinerary, but spent our most time in the city during a 4-day stay in the middle of our circuit. If you're in northern India, it's hard to avoid coming through Delhi multiple times while visiting other cities, which can feel a bit restricting.

We didn't enjoy New Delhi very much. It's the third-largest city in the world by population, more than twice as populous as New York City. While it has a very nice, new metro system, and extensive links to the country's rail system, it doesn't have much other infrastructure to make it easy or enjoyable to get around. We really enjoy walking to explore new places, and that was tough here: most roads have no sidewalks (or sidewalks that are now parking lots), there are touts constantly trying to talk to you, even outside touristy areas, and _everywhere_ is busy. 

We finally found a couple of nice respites from the chaos, but nothing that would make us want to visit again as tourists.

## <i class="fa fa-check-square" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#2495C4;"></i> How We Did with Our Budget

For our time in Delhi, we had budgeted as much as 45 USD a night for accommodations. We ended up spending only 33 USD per night for our `Suite` room at **Hotel Tokyo Palace**, which ended up being a really wonderful hotel. We had also budgeted 10 USD per day per person for food and 10 USD per day per person for entertainment. Out of that planned 40 USD total, we ended up spending only 15 USD per day on average, with a whopping 17 USD of that coming from our mediocre dinner at 1st Gate. Granted, our stay included a full day at the hotel because I was feeling sick, and most of meals at our hotel because it ended up being so good, but Jaisalmer was definitely a much better value than anywhere else we've been in India.
