While we flew in and out of Tokyo-Narita airport on our [around the world air ticket](LINK), our first stop in Japan was Osaka. We stayed for about a week, ate as much ramen as we could, walked a _ton_, and really enjoyed it. It may just be because it is such a contrast to our [experience in India](LINK), but we were really thankful for how walkable the city is and how willing everyone was to try to honestly help us.

We decided to stay in Osaka, rather than the more-popular-among-tourists Kyoto because throughout our trip we've enjoyed good food and residential neighborhoods a lot more than temples and tourist hotspots. Plus, with a Japan Rail Pass in-hand, Kyoto was just 15 minutes on the Shinkansen "bullet train" away.

Osaka and the surrounding area was one of the most livable destinations we've traveled to so far. The public transportation is _amazing_, most everyone seems to bicycle around for shorter trips, and everything is clean and safe. It honestly left both of us wishing we could easily learn Japanese and spend more time here.

## <i class="fa fa-check-square" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#2495C4;"></i> What We Did in Osaka

**Day 1:** arrival at NRT, rail pass exchange, n'ex, shinkansen, metro to dotonbori, check-in, walk through market, cheap ramen

We landed in Tokyo early in the morning after an overnight flight, made our way through one of the most efficient immigration/customs systems we've had the joy of encountering on our trip, and immediately found the JR East Ticket Office so that we could trade our rail pass vouchers for actual rail passes (more on that, and trains here in general, to come in a separate post). Exactly an hour after we walked off our plane we were standing on the airport's train platform waiting for our Narita Express train into downtown Tokyo.

Once we arrived at Tokyo Station we got our first taste of Tokyo rush-hour crowds, but managed to buy contactless reloadable metro cards that work not only in Tokyo but pretty much all over Japan. We also stopped at **Ekibenya Matsuri**, a large shop inside the Shinkansen selling countless varieties of `ekiben`, which is the name for any bento box sold at a train station or onboard a train. While they have pictures of what is in each box, no descriptions are in English, so we made some educated guesses and grabbed a couple boxes to enjoy on our 3-hour train to Osaka.

Once we arrived at Shin-Osaka Station, we got to use those metro cards for the first time to travel about 15 minutes to the **Dotonbori neighborhood**, where our Airbnb was. We met the host, got out key, and immediately took a brief rest since we were pretty exhausted from two consecutive nights of travel (first a train to Delhi, then our flight to Tokyo). Our flight landed outside Tokyo just before 7am and we got to our Airbnb in Osaka by 2:30pm, even with generous connection times on our trains to make it less stressfulâ€“pretty good!

Before we went to sleep, we took a walk to explore the neighborhood. The nearby market was already closing up for the day, but we walked through the heart of touristy Dotonbori and had our first successful interaction with a Japanese vending machine: we got ramen at **Kinryu Ramen**, where like a lot of other places you make you selection at a vending machine, pay, and then simply hand your ticket to the cook/server. It's an amazingly efficient system, especially since most vending machines can handle giving change in both bills and coins, so you don't have to worry about having exact change. While Kinryu is much less popular than some of the surrounding stores with block-long lines, it was good and about half the price of other nearby meals.

With food in our stomach and facing exhaustion we stopped at a cheap grocery store our Airbnb host had recommended, stocked up on some soup and fruit for breakfast, and were asleep by 9pm!

**Day 2:** osaka castle, riverside park, cherry blossoms galore, first okanomayaki

**Day 3:** down to southern neighborhood, Tokoyaki, park w/ red bridge, melon bread ice cream, touristy ramen place

**Day 4:** kyoto trip: bullet trains, temple with all the gates, nishkin? market, attempted running sushi, ramen by train stop, river walk, tea ceremony, nate temple visit, old kyoto neighborhood park, Pablo, walk, geisha + bad tourists, 

**Day 5:** boring work time, lunch at katsu place, melon bread ice cream hotter, sake tasting, dinner at chibo okanomiyaki

**Day 6:** kobe trip: bullet trains, misadventures on finding the trail head, herbal foot bath, nice park, fast walk down-long wait

**Day 7:** baseball tickets, departure (in green car?)

## <i class="fa fa-check-square" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#2495C4;"></i> How We Did with Our Budget in Osaka

For our visit to Japan, we budgeted more than almost anywhere else we're going (and kept the overall time in Japan to two weeks, when we otherwise may have stretched it out a bit more). After so much time in Southeast Asia, prices have definitely been a bit of a shock, but it is ultimately pretty comparable to DC if you stay away from the 30 USD gourmet sushi boxes and dozens of Michelin-starred restaurants.

For our time in Osaka, we had budgeted as much as 90 USD a night for accommodations. We ended up spending 78 USD per night for our Airbnb in Osaka, which had a small kitchenette and everything we needed, despite being in total about the size of our bedroom back in DC.

We had also budgeted 20 USD per day per person for food and 15 USD per day per person for entertainment. Out of that planned 70 USD total, we ended up spending 61 USD per day on average, including almost 50 USD total on metro trips around Osaka and Kyoto. We budgeted separately for our two-week nationwide Japan Rail Pass, which end up costing about 30 USD per person per day (but are still way cheaper than buying bullet train tickets individually!).
