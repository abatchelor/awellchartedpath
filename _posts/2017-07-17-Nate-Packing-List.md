## <i class="fa fa-check-square" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#2495C4;"></i> The Backpack
 
I chose the <a href="https://www.tortugabackpacks.com/products/outbreaker-travel-backpack" target="_blank"> Tortuga</a>. It is a compact bag with plenty of pockets to keep everything organized. It also has adjustable straps to make it customizzable to what is most comfortable for you.

## <i class="fa fa-check-square" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#2495C4;"></i> Odds and Ends

- 1 travel pillow – When you're doing over a dozen flights, several trains, and who knows how many buses; comfortable sleeping and a fancier pillow while traveling will make or break your experience. I used <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001DYDAEK/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B001DYDAEK&linkCode=as2&tag=awellchartedp-20&linkId=f821df93546541e0e25bd52cea239af9" target="_blank"> this one</a> https://www.tortugabackpacks.com/products/outbreaker-travel-backpackIt is a splurge but it will hopefully make the 35 hours in the air between Hawaii and South Africa more bearable.
- 1 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01IFOED8W/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B01IFOED8W&linkCode=as2&tag=awellchartedp-20&linkId=0b0337a856fbf81dca2a0565c2f9ee7a" target="_blank"> eye cover</a> –See travel pillow.
- Ear plugs– See travel pillow. I used these while I was working in an open office with some chatty co-workers. Whenever I needed to concentrate, I could put these in and get to work. Hopefully they stand up to trains and planes just as well.
- 1 water bottle– collapsible is really wonderful. Now that I've had one, I'll never go back.
- 1 travel towel - we looked at wirecutter for recommendation (as you always should) and they recommended a high-end linen towel to avoid the smell issues associated with synthetic travel towels. We went with linen towels but at a fraction of the cost. I've tried <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MTPU4CJ/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B01MTPU4CJ&linkCode=as2&tag=awellchartedp-20&linkId=676099f70c4badc1d5578a2fc85610b4
" target="_blank"> this one</a> out already and I love it. It also rolls up much smaller than the synthetic towel I originally planned to take.
- 1 small flashlight
- 1 collapsible cup– a nice <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HWNNLCW/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00HWNNLCW&linkCode=as2&tag=awellchartedp-20&linkId=ed7917b4b18a75fa20529cfb5d15d025" target="_blank"> Sea to Summit</a> cup for when you need wine on a train, or in a park, or some other beverage you'd like to share.
- Laundry cable
- Laundry detergent sheets

## <i class="fa fa-check-square" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#2495C4;"></i> Electronics

- 1 Kindle- Dealing with my need to books (I aim to read 15,000 pages each year) was always going to be tough. I love real books, usually from the library, but for travel the Kindle is the best.
- 1 smart phone- Nate will be using a Pixel, both as a phone and a comera.
- 1 phone charger
- 1 plug adapter
- 1 Macbook Air
