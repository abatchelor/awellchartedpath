## Pre-Trip Checklist 

## The Idea Phase

This phase can last as long as you'd like. Our lasted almost 5 years before we finally pulled the trigger on our trip. Use this time to daydream about places you could go, watch movies, read books, and ask all your friends what places they've loved visiting.

This will help you determine some important factors for your trip. Mainly how much you'll need to save. How long before you could leave for your trip is intamately tied to that number. Maybe you need to pinch pennies for 6 months or maybe it's 2 years, either way having a ball park number will help you take the steps you need.
