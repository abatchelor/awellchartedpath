I had been looking forward to visiting Copenhagen for a long time because it's the main piece of my heritage I know of and was excited that we were able to schedule 8 days in the area so we could really settle in and explore. My ancestors came from the northwest of Denmark, so quite far from Copenhagen, but it was still really interesting for me to get to spend some time in the country.

While we were amazed at the high prices for everything (driven by a 25% VAT and a high minimum wage, but offset by amazing social services for residents) we ended up having a really good time and actually _under_ spending our budget because it was so nice to just be outdoors. We really lucked out with the weather, with every day except our departure being beautiful and warm–seven summer days in a city that averages only 6 of them a year (but has had 30+ this year)!

We stayed at an Airbnb in the **Islands Brygge** area, just across the "river" (actually a narrow strip of water connected on both ends to the Baltic Sea) from the core of downtown. We ended up with a lovely apartment and found the location pretty convenient, especially with the **Bycyklen** e-bikeshare that we easily signed up for and used throughout our time in Copenhagen. Our side of the water is also much less built-up, so it has a nice promenade for walking along the water and popular areas for you to jump in the water and cool off on hot days.

### Food!

Copenhagen is known for its fancy-dining food, having hosted the best restaurant in the world for years, but we found pretty good options that didn't completely blow our budget.

**Gasoline Grill** - 

**Andersen's Bakery** - 

**Bæst** - We had seen Baest on the pizza episode of David Chang's Netflix show Ugly Delicious and I got pretty excited about it after they talked through their homemade sourdough crust and fresh-made-daily local cheese. It's not cheap, but at abou 20 USD a pizza it's actually not _that_ much more expensive than random take-out pizza throughout Copenhagen. We **loved** their fresh burrata, served as a huge blob of flavorful cheese that is impossible to stop eating. We also really liked their garlic bread and lardo appetizer, which was soaked in flavorful oil and also addictive. The pizza was less exciting than expected, to be honest, since their sourdough was nowhere near as sour as I like it. We still enjoyed it, especially their ['Nduja](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%27Nduja) selection. We had trouble getting a reservation for a good time, but it also wasn't full either time we went there, so you may be able to just walk in and be seated.

For our time in Copenhagen, the most expensive city we're to paying visit in Europe (Basel, Switzerland is comparable, but luckily we got to stay with Amy's parents!), we had budgeted 85 USD a night for accommodations. We ended up spending 94 USD per night for our Airbnb in Islands Brygge, and feel we got really lucky getting such a good deal compared to the other available options. 

We had also budgeted 15 USD per day per person for food and 20 USD per day per person for entertainment. Out of that planned 70 USD total, we ended up spending only 63 USD per day on average since stuck almost entirely to free sightseeing activities (47 USD on Bycycklen bikeshare, 16 USD on the walking tour, and 31 USD to get to/from Bakken were all we spent on entertainment) and didn't have many restaurant meals (though we did average 75 USD on two trips to Baest, which we don't regret!). Overall we ended up just barely underspending our total Copenhagen budget, which we were surprised at being able to accomplish.
