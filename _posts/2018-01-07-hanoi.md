## <i class=“fa fa-check-square” aria-hidden=“true” style=“color:#2495C4;”></i> Good morning Vietnam and Hello Hanoi

We arrived in Hanoi pretty exhausted after our [overnight train from Bagan to Yangon](http://site.awellchartedpath.com/blog/2018/01/Bagan-train/) and then a same day flight to Hanoi. By the time we finally arrived at the **New Vision Hotel** it was after 10:00pm and we were faced with what we soon realized would bet he most over the top costumer service experience we would ever receive. The amount of information we were provided and the number of questions asked about our plans, whether we needed arrangements, directions, reccommendations, or anything else (all of which would be repeated by anyone we happened accross coming in or going out of the hotel). The room was very nice though with a small balcony and blissfully hot water. 

We only had a few days to explore Hanoi and the weather wasn’t very cooperative with misty mornings and afternoon drizzle. Honestly the best part about our time was the food and the drinks. 

Similar to Yangon, there are many street vendors selling a single particular dish to hungery diners on tiny plastic furniture and these inevitably were our favorites.

**Food**

Cha Ca- A fried white fish with dill and ginger that you prepare yourself on a table-top burner that is served with noodles, greens, and broth. 

Bun Cha- Grilled pork meatballs (made over small fires on the sidewalk mostly) with meat and a sweet broth. One stall we tried (my favorite) added a kind of pastery wrapping to the meatballs and a bit of seafood as well. 

Pho- This is the noodle soup dish that most represented Vietnamese food for us living in the US but here it is just better. 

Bahn Mi- Bahn is just the word for bread or baguette that is a hold over from the French occupation of Vietnam. This is a tasty snack or meal. Nate was willing to try one with pate but I’ve passed on it so far. 

Egg Coffee- coffee made with egg yolks, sugar, and condensed milk. There is coffee and then a thick egg cream on top. It’s definitely more dessert than coffee but it is delicious. 

**Attractions** 

We made the trip to the **Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum** only to find that it seemed to be closed but we couldn’t figure out why. It’s an impressive building with guards guarding the door and patroling the area. Because it was closed, we didn’t see the embalmed Ho Chi Minh. 

We walked across the **Long Bien Bridge**, which was bombed several times during thte Vietnam War but was rebuilt again and again. The bridge today is functional but not the nicest walk. The “sidewalk” is really just concrete slabs across metal beams and some are cracked, some are loose, and there are gaps between all of them to see down to the ground/river below. Walking out for Nate to take a few pictures is probably the most uncomfortable I’ve been in awhile, with my fear of heights getting kicked into high gear. It’s not that high but there seemed to be a much more real danger of falling through with one wrong step. We obviously didn’t plummit to our deaths though and my heartbeat and adreniline levels eventually receeded. 

One of the major attractions in Hanoi is the **Hanoi Hilton** or Hoa Lo Prison. It was originally built by the French to hold Vietnamese anti-colonial political prisoners. This history is the main focus of the museum with glowing propaganda about the “revered heroes and martyrs” who never gave up the fight, continued to spread the teachings of revolution and never turned against one another despite deporable conditions imposed upon them by the “worldly-wise, cunning and experienced jailers, cruel overseers and stool-pigeons” (from the tourist information booklet you can purchase upon entrance). 

There are also exhibits about the period of the prison’s history when it was used to house American POWs shot down over Hanoi and the surrounding area. These exhibits spoke about the hospitable treatment of the Americans with an entire exhibit dedicated to letters written by POWs while they were being kept in the prison. One letter was written by a pilot to his family talking about how he now realized how cruel he was, how wrong the war was, and how greateful he was for his gracious hosts. Reading this letter was probably the thing that made me most uncomfortable. It sounded so forced and led me to try to imagine the circumstances under which it was written. 

The language of the museum is clearly not of an unbiased nature, there is clearly an agenda, but it was still an interesting stop that I would recommend. Just bring a healthy dose of skepticism with you. 
  
Far from the sobering visit to the Hanoi Hilton, we also made a trip to the popular street of bars and restaurants called **Beer Corner**. Maybe I’m becoming less fun as I get older but the packed street full of pushy touts getting in your face to try to bring you to their bar or yelling the happy hour specials was an overload in the worst way. We instead opted to have a couple of drinks at cafes on teh fringe of the area and people watch, which was a much more enjoyable way to spend the evening. 
 
**Dong Xuan Market** is a huge, multi-level market packed to nearly bursting with clothes, shoes, and trinkets of all varieties. It is geared more toward locals than tourists and there are smalled shops lining the surrounding streets. We wandered through the tiny paths between vendors to explore but because it is technically winter (though still in the 60s-70s everyday) the main attraction was endless winter coats of every variety. 
  
One of the more peaceful activities we enjoyed was walking along two of the lakes in Hanoi: **Ho Tay lake and Hoan Kiem Lake**. The first is larger and we only covered a small section but stopped for coffee at a coffee shop right on the water to watch the fish eating at the surface while I enjoyed a Vietnamese coffee compelete with condensed milk and tasting like a delicious dessert. 

 Hoan Kiem Lake is much smaller and we walked around the entire area. There is a pedestrian path all the way around that is slightly removed from the cars and motorbikes weaving in and out. There are also plenty of benches to sit and enjoy the view. There are vendors, usually women, who carry produce or trinkets in baskets hanging from either end of a long wooden pole who will either try to sell you something or get you to hold their wares for a photo. Generally they would move on quickly though.   


## <i class=“fa fa-check-square” aria-hidden=“true” style=“color:#2495C4;”></i> Cat Ba Island and Lan Ha Bay

We deliberated a lot about whether or not we wanted to go to Ha Long Bay. We had heard that it was crowded and pretty dirty these days as tourism had boomed to a potentially irresponsible level but that it was also gorgeous and completely worth going. Torn, we eventually decided to see some of the less famous bays nearby and opted for a trip to Cat Ba, one of 4 inhabited islands out of over 1,000 in the bays off Haiphong. From there, we would be able to see Lan Ha Bay just south of Ha Long. We would still get to see the limestone islands and beautiful green water but at a fraction of the cost and hopefully with fewer of our fellow tourists. 

**Getting to Cat Ba**

There are many services to take tourists back and forth from Hanoi to Cat Ba. To get there, we decided to take the public train to Haiphong and then a hydro-foil to Cat Ba Town. Many of the other services take you to the port on the far side of the island and then you have to take a crowded and undependable public bus or pay for a taxi across the island. 

The train trip was lovely, the train was nicer than Amrak and left right on time. Other than one other backpacking couple the train seemed to be full of locals. The best part was that the tickets only cost 6 USD for the two of us. 

Once we got to Haiphong, we walked almost a mile to the pier to get our hydro-foil. We could have taken a taxi but the walk really wasn’t bad. 

We had read warnings in advance that there would likely be women selling tickets for boats as we approached for less than the advertised price but to watch out because these were usually for boats leaving from a different pier and once you realized they would then charge a premium for a bus to the pier where your boat actually was. Just as predicted, there were two women standing in front of mini-buses selling boat tickets but we passed them by. 

Then we arrived to the pier to find that all the ticket counters where we should have been able to buy tickets were empty. There were bags and coats that meant there were clearly people at work that day but they were no where to be found. At that point we still had plenty of time so we decided to grab some noodles for lunch and wait for them to get back. Five minutes before the boat was scheduled to leave there was still no sign of employees. There was a man selling tickets just in front of the counter though. Wary, Nate quized him about where the boat went, how long it was supposed to take, that the ticket was for the boat sitting right there, and that the price was the same listed. Without much other choice, we bought the tickets. Luckily Nate caught that the man had tried to give him a 10,000 Dong note as change when it should have been 100,000 Dong and then we walked toward the boat to find a small group of people (we assume the missing employees) sitting ready to take our tickets. Seems they hadn’t disappeared after all but were just out of sight enough for this other man to sell ticket (and try to make a profit with improper change?). Still, we got on the right boat going to the right place and we were able to walk to our hotel from there. Not too bad in the end. 


**Exploring Cat Ba** 

Arriving in the early afternoon gave us enough time to check-out the Cannon Fort in Cat Ba. We opted to walk up the hill (about X miles) rather than getting a taxi or renting a motorbike. The attraction value of Cannon Hill is pretty low. There are a couple of anti-aircraft guns with manequinns acting out firing them, a museum of historical items like a telephone, canteens, and uniforms, and a tunnel you can walk through where they could take shelter from American bombers during the Vietnam War. The main attraction is the view from the top though. From the restaurant you have a great view of the bay and surrounding islands. On a sunny day it would have been spectacular but even on our very overcast visit it was still a great view. 

**Kayaking, kayaking, and more kayaking**

When we planned our time on Cat Ba, I knew we wouldn’t have very long but I wanted to get full value from our time. Admittedly, the picture I had in my head while I was planning our adventures was one of sunshine sparkling on bright green waters, swimming to cool off, and lounging on beaches. We also knew that we did not want to join a party boat. We saw several of them and did not regret our decision. Instead, I book us a full day of kayaking with **Blue Swimmer Saling** in Lan Ha Bay. When I say full day, I’m not kidding either. We started with an 8am pick-up and we were tucked snuggley into our double kayak with skirts to keep us a little more dry by 9am. We didn’t get back until after 4pm. Granted we stopped for lunch and for a couple of breaks but mostly we kayaked.  

The views of the limestone islands from the kayak were amazing, even without the sunshine. The water was a bright green color in most places and we were able to peak into caves and pop into peaceful lagoons along the way. While there was definitely trash in the water (so many plastic bottles) there were only a couple of areas I noticed oiliness at the surface of the water and it was far better than what I had expected based on reports from Ha Long Bay. 

We also got to paddle by some fish farms, watch some fishermen collect and wash clams to be taken to market, and visit a little resort with a beach for some lunch and relaxing. 

I’m glad we didn’t just hire a day-trip on one of the many boats. Being close to the water and having more flexibility to linger was great. I do wish I had picket the half day boat cruise with half day kayaking though. After our 8 hour adventure, my arms were so sore I could barely use by chopsticks to eat Pho for dinner. I wish I could say I was exaggerating when I say my arms have never been so sore. It was definitely too much kayaking and I’m in pretty good shape. 

**Back to Hanoi**

Even though we enjoyed our trip to Cat Ba on the public train, we had to take a transfer service back to Hanoi. The hydro-foil timing and the train timing were such that we would either have to make the switch in Haiphong in under 30 minutes or spend at least 4 hours there waiting for our train. Since we were leaving again the same night on an overnight train to Hoi An, missing the train to Hanoi was not a good option. So, we took **Good Morning Cat Ba** for 16 USD per person and got back with plenty of time to get some more tasty food, try and egg coffee (highly recommend, even though I usually prefer unsweetened coffee), and still make our train.
