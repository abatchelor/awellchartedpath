For years, I’ve spent more time than I should reading travel blogs and looking at the inspirational photos of beautiful people in beautiful places on Instagram and in magazines. When you are day-dreaming about travel, the perfect images people share shape how you think about what your big trip will be like. Somewhere in the back of your mind, you know that they probably spent ages setting up for just the right shot and then editing out any imperfections but it still gets in your head. Honestly, I’m also guilty of sharing my prettiest photos with people to show them what a wonderful time I’m having. 

Well, long-term travel is wonderful. You see a lot of beautiful things. It is also mundane and sometimes annoying but you don’t see that part very often.

For example, my number one annoying activity is laundry. Laundry is a huge pain. We packed light for the trip. A backpack can only hold so many outfits and it means we have to do laundry regularly. Washing machines are few and far between and after only 3 months at this point I have a new and deep appreciation for their magical existence. We felt good about our purchase of a travel washing “machine” (i.e. bag) to make our lives easier. It does make our lives a little easier but you can only wash 2 shirts and a handful of underwear in each load. Each load requires you to fill the bag with water, then soap, massage it around agressively, empty the water, fill it with water again, massage it around agressively, and sometimes repeat the rinsing again. If we’ve been bad and left laundry for too long, we may have to do this 3-4 times over. Sounds fun right? 

Then comes the drying. We have yet to come across a dryer. So, we string up our clothes, sometimes outside, sometimes in the bathroom, sometimes in the living room. Some places they dry overnight but others it takes two days and we haven’t even got to the humidity of SE Asia yet. 




Finally, if you ever want to feel humble or maybe a little stupid, travel can definitely help with that. For example, there were the times when I couldn’t speak Portuguese and instead resorted to German. Or there was the time that a waitress, before we even opened the door to an empanada restaurant in Buenos Aires, identified us as tourists and started speaking English to us. Then when she brought us our delicious smelling tomales, she was nice enough to explain to us that we were not supposed to eat the husks around the tomales but _open it up and eat the inside_.
