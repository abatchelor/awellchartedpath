## Pick your starting location

Exploit miles you have/can get
Link back to pricing section

## Pick your continents

N.A vs SWP

## Find high-value stops

Places we'd never otherwise go; Easter Island, Mauritius

## Pay attention to the weather

Spreadsheet, planning of overall direction and then order within continents

## Pick flights with flexibility when possible

Check to see if they're daily or more rare - easier to change a daily flight later than one that only goes once a week
