            <p>We are two people who spent a year traveling a well charted path. </p>
            <p>We traveled to 33 countries across 6 continents over 11 months. </p>
            <p>After a couple of fits and starts we ended up planning this trip for about 5 years before we actually took it and we have a Google Sheets database full of content developed over those years. 
            We have detailed budgets, itineraries, and lots of lessons learned that we'll share here; as well all the details of what we did along the way.  </p>
